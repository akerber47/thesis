\begin{acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I'd like to thank my advisor, Ian Agol. Without your
guidance, leadership, and support, this dissertation would not exist.

%Thank you especially for your patience through my long break from serious
%mathematics.

%^cut this last sentence?

I also want to thank my committee: Denis Auroux, Martin Olsson, and Martin
White. You were a great help during my early, confused years.

Thanks also to Jason Manning and Saul Schleimer for valuable conversations.
Thanks to Kevin Donaghue, Kyle Miller, and Franco e Vargas Pallete for many
good conversations, and lots of help and support.

Thank you to Rich Schwartz and Jeff Brock of Brown University, who first taught
me about geometry and topology. Thanks also to Zev Chonoles, Andy Furnas, Alex
Kruckman, and Aaron Mazel-Gee for a great time at Brown doing math. Your
enthusiasm is contagious.

Thank you to Dan Abramovich, Paul Bamberg, Stephen Lichtenbaum, Emmanuel
"Manny" Sodbinow, and Mike Rosen for fostering my interest in mathematics.

Thank you to the Triple Rock Seminar: Shishir Agrawal, Harrison Chen, Gus
Schrader, Noah Schweber, Clare Stichcombe, and Markus Vasquez. I wouldn't have
passed my qualifying exam without you.

My time at Berkeley would not have been the same without the Cal Ballroom dance
team and Team 106. Thanks to all my coaches: Roberta Sun, Natalia Barantseva,
An Hoang, Andrey Tarasov, Yulia Kuznetsova, and most of all Ikaika Dowsett. Of
course, my greatest thanks to Brittany Whitehill. You've been a great  partner
and friend.

Thank you to my all my friends and family. You kept me on track and pointed the
right way, and you were there for me when I needed you the most.

Finally, thank you to Katharine, for everything. You believed in me, even when
I didn't believe in myself.
