Let $M$ be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold. $M$ can be realized as the
quotient manifold of a Kleinian group $\Gamma$. One can ask whether $\pi_1M$
contains any quasifuchsian surface subgroups. To tackle this problem
topologically, we represent a Kleinian group with a pared 3-manifold $(M,P)$.
The pared structure $P\cin\bd M$ specifies the boundary locus corresponding to
cusps of the parabolic group elements.

Finding a quasifuchsian surface subgroup of the Kleinian group boils down to
asking whether we can find a closed immersed $\pi_1$-injective surface which
avoids this pared locus up to homotopy. That is, we're trying to choose
a surface subgroup of $\pi_1M$ which does not contain any of the peripherial
subgroups associated to components of $P$. The general question is: for which
choices of $(M,P)$ can we find such a surface subgroup?

There is some existing work on this problem. Cooper-Long-Reid \cite{CLR}
addressed the underlying topological problem, showing that a compact connected
irreducible 3-manifold with non-empty incompressible boundary  must contain an
essential closed surface, unless it's covered by a product $F\times I$.
However, this surface may contain accidental parabolics, that is, overlap with
the pared locus $P$. If this occurs it will not be quasifuchsian.

In the closed case, there is the work of Kahn-Markovic \cite{KM}. They proved
that there always exists an immersed closed $\pi_1$-injective surface in any
closed hyperbolic 3-manifold.  Such a surface is necessarily quasifuchsian
because the surface is closed, so the pared structure is empty. Finally,
Masters-Zhang \cite{MZ} showed that every finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold
with cusps contains a quasifuchsian surface subgroup. An alternate proof was
provided by Baker-Cooper \cite{BC}.

The remaining case is infinite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. So far we've only
addressed a particular example of this case --- books of $I$-bundles. We
conjecture that all books of $I$-bundles admit quasifuchsian surface subgroups,
except for a few obvious negative cases where the pared locus is too large. We
prove this in a few special cases, so far.
