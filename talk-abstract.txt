Quasi-Fuchsian Surface Subgroups

Given a geometrically finite Kleinian group, we can ask whether it contains any
quasi-Fuchsian surface subgroups. The answer is yes for closed hyperbolic
3-manifolds (Kahn-Markovic) and more generally for finite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds (Masters-Zhang, Baker-Cooper). We'll discuss some background on
this problem and outline a strategy for the case of infinite volume. We'll then
present new results for an infinite-volume special case, books of I-bundles.

Title: Quasi-Fuchsian Surface Subgroups II

Abstract:

Last week we reduced the problem of finding quasi-Fuchsian surface
subgroups to a purely topological question about surfaces in pared
3-manifolds. After restating this topological question, we will
present the proof in a special case, books of I-bundles. This material
is independent of the previous talk.
