Quasi-Fuchsian Surface Subgroups

Given a geometrically finite Kleinian group, we can ask whether it contains any
quasi-Fuchsian surface subgroups. The answer is yes for closed hyperbolic
3-manifolds (Kahn-Markovic) and more generally for finite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds (Masters-Zhang, Baker-Cooper). We'll discuss some background on
this problem and outline a strategy for the case of infinite volume. We'll then
present new results for an infinite-volume special case, books of I-bundles.
