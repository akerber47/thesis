\section{LERF and topological consequences}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following is based on \cite{AFW} and \cite{LR}. It is definitely not
original.

\begin{defn}

Let G be a group. G is residually finite, or RF, if for any g in G, there
exists a finite index subgroup H<G such that g notin H.

Let $G$ be a group, and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. $H$ is \emph{separable} in $G$
if for any $g \in G$, $g \notin H$, there exists a finite index subgroup $H'<G$
such that $H'>H$, and $g \notin H'$.

$G$ is \emph{subgroup separable}, or \emph{LERF}, if all its finitely generated
subgroups are separable.

\end{defn}

It is well-known that these are equivalent to the following facts: (see
\cite{LR}). We'll use these facts later in our proof.

$G$ is RF if and only if for any $g \in G$ there exists a map $\phi \colon
G \to F$, where $F$ is a finite group, such that $\phi(g) \neq id$.

- $G$ is LERF if and only if for any $g \in G$, $H < G$, $g \notin H$, there
exists a map $\phi \colon G \to F$ such that $\phi(g) \notin \phi(H)$.

Note that in this entire paper, \emph{surface groups} will refer to fundamental
groups of closed surfaces (compact without boundary).
% TODO move this sentence somewhere. Probably want to clarify what I mean by
% hyperbolic 3-manifold, etc also...

\begin{thm}[Hall] Free groups are LERF. \end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Scott] Surface groups are LERF. \end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Agol--Kahn--Markovic--Wise] Let $N$ by a hyperbolic 3-manifold,
possibly infinite volume.  Then $\pi_1N$ is LERF. \end{thm}

\begin{proof}

See citations in \cite{LR}, \cite{AFW}.

\end{proof}

Note that the last theorem is actually an extremely deep fact. Wise's proof
actually shows that hyperbolic 3-manifold with boundary groups satisfy
a technical condition, namely that they are virtually compact special. (Other
cases of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, including the particularly difficult closed
case, were addressed by the overlapping work of Agol, Kahn-Markovic, Sageev,
and Bergeron-Wise).  Additional work by Haglund and Haglund-Wise demonstrates
that a virtual compact special group is virtually a quasiconvex subgroup of
a right-angled Artin group, and geometrically finite subgroups are separable.
It follows by the tameness theorem that hyperbolic 3-manifold groups are LERF.

lemma (lifting to embeddings)

Let M be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold, and phi: S to M be a pi1-injective
map such that H=phi*pi1S is quasiFuchsian. Then phi is homotopic to a map which
lifts to an embedding in a cover of M. Furthermore, we can choose such a cover
to be finite-sheeted.

% TODO
%This belongs in background somewhere. Reduction to finite-sheeted cover means
%this is an application of separability, so maybe put with topological facts
%there?

% Update: This location still doesn't quite make sense. Keep at it..
