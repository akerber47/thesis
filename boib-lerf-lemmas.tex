\section{LERF and topological consequences}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following is based on \cite{AFW} and \cite{LR}. It is definitely not
original.

\begin{defn}

Let G be a group. G is residually finite, or RF, if for any g in G, there
exists a finite index subgroup H<G such that g notin H.

Let $G$ be a group, and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. $H$ is \emph{separable} in $G$
if for any $g \in G$, $g \notin H$, there exists a finite index subgroup $H'<G$
such that $H'>H$, and $g \notin H'$.

$G$ is \emph{subgroup separable}, or \emph{LERF}, if all its finitely generated
subgroups are separable.

\end{defn}

It is well-known that these are equivalent to the following facts: (see
\cite{LR}). We'll use these facts later in our proof.

$G$ is RF if and only if for any $g \in G$ there exists a map $\phi \colon
G \to F$, where $F$ is a finite group, such that $\phi(g) \neq id$.

- $G$ is LERF if and only if for any $g \in G$, $H < G$, $g \notin H$, there
exists a map $\phi \colon G \to F$ such that $\phi(g) \notin \phi(H)$.

Note that in this entire paper, \emph{surface groups} will refer to fundamental
groups of closed surfaces (compact without boundary).
% TODO move this sentence somewhere. Probably want to clarify what I mean by
% hyperbolic 3-manifold, etc also...

\begin{thm}[Hall] Free groups are LERF. \end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Scott] Surface groups are LERF. \end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Agol--Kahn--Markovic--Wise] Let $N$ by a hyperbolic 3-manifold,
possibly infinite volume.  Then $\pi_1N$ is LERF. \end{thm}

\begin{proof}

See citations in \cite{LR}, \cite{AFW}.

\end{proof}

Note that the last theorem is actually an extremely deep fact. Wise's proof
actually shows that hyperbolic 3-manifold with boundary groups satisfy
a technical condition, namely that they are virtually compact special. (Other
cases of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, including the particularly difficult closed
case, were addressed by the overlapping work of Agol, Kahn-Markovic, Sageev,
and Bergeron-Wise).  Additional work by Haglund and Haglund-Wise demonstrates
that a virtual compact special group is virtually a quasiconvex subgroup of
a right-angled Artin group, and geometrically finite subgroups are separable.
It follows by the tameness theorem that hyperbolic 3-manifold groups are LERF.

%lemma (lifting to embeddings)
%
%Let M be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold, and phi: S to M be a pi1-injective
%map such that H=phi*pi1S is quasiFuchsian. Then phi is homotopic to a map
%%which
%lifts to an embedding in a cover of M. Furthermore, we can choose such a cover
%to be finite-sheeted.
%
% TODO
%This belongs in background somewhere. Reduction to finite-sheeted cover means
%this is an application of separability, so maybe put with topological facts
%there?

% Update: This location still doesn't quite make sense. Keep at it..

We now describe some elementary topological consequences of LERF. These exact
statements are new, but most of the following propositions are simple
translations of the conclusions of LERF into topological statements about loops
and covers.

prop

Let X be a space such that pi1X is LERF. Fix a basepoint x0 in X. Suppose that
Y cin X is a homotopically nontrivial connected subspace containing x0, and
alpha is a loop at x0 which is not homotopic into Y. Then there is
a finite-sheeted regular cover p colon (X',x0') to (X,x0) with the property
that the lift alpha' of alpha to x0 connects two different connected components
of p-1(Y).

end prop

prop

Let X be a space such that pi1X is LERF. Fix a basepoint x0 in X. Suppose that
alpha and beta are homotopically nontrivial loops at x0 such that alpha is not
homotopic to a multiple of beta. Then there is a finite-sheeted regular cover
p colon (X',x0') to (X,x0) with the property that, when we consider the lift
alpha' of alpha to x0' has its right endpoint at a point not reachable by
lifting multiples of beta to x0'.

end prop

prop

Let X be a space such that pi1X is LERF. Fix a basepoint x0 in X. Suppose that
we have a homotopically nontrivial loop alpha at x0 of infinite order in pi1X.
Then given an integer k>0, there is a finite-sheeted regular cover p colon
(X',x0') to (X,x0) with the following property. Consider the component C of
p-1(alpha) that contains x0'. Let d be the degree of the restricted covering
map p|C ccoln C to alpha. Then k divides d.

end prop

prop

Consider a finite collection of basepoints x1,dots,xn with corresponding loops
alphai and subspaces Yi at each basepoint xi. Then there is a finite-sheeted
regular cover X' to X such that each pair alphai,Yi satisfies the conclusion of
\ref{L:lerf1} (where X' is regular, so the choice of lifted basepoints is
arbitrary).

end prop

prop

Consider a finite collection of basepoints x1,dots,xn with corresponding loops
alphai,betai at each basepoint xi. Then there is a finite-sheeted regular cover
X' to X such that each pair alphai,betai satisfies the conclusion of
\ref{L:lerf2} (where X' is regular, so the choice of lifted basepoints is
arbitrary).

end prop

Consider a finite collection of basepoints x1,dots,xn with corresponding loops
alphai at each basepoint xi. Then given integers k1,dots,kn>0, there is
a finite-sheeted regular cover p colon X' to X such that each pair alphai,ki
satisfies the conclusion of \ref{L:lerf3} (again, X' is regular, so the choice
of lifted basepoints is arbitrary).
