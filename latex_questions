How to build bibliography

Q: Citation syntax
A: \cite{ABC}

Q: Formatting of theorems and stuff (what does newtheorem do?)
A: These are called proclamations. Define at top with
\newtheorem{myid}{MyTheoremThing}
Use with
\begin{myid}
...
\end{myid}
To number consecutively
\newtheorem{mynewid}[otherid]{MyNewTheoremThing}
to get MyNewTheoremThing and MyTheoremThing to use same numbers
To number with section dots
\newtheorem{mynewid}{MyNewTheoremThing}[section]
AMS has 3 theorem styles: plain, definition, remark

Q: def vs newcommand
A: use newcommand. def overrides stuff.
IMPORTANT: never use custom commands in title, abstract, bibliography, captions

Q: stupid colon thing for functions
A: \colon

Q: minus vs setminus (need to figure this out. Minus is really ugly - spaced
too wide. What to do?)
A: set subtraction is just \setminus
but I think just a minus sign actually looks ok

Q: how to type disjoint union
A: \sqcup

Q: how to format "condition (*)"
(want it centered with the * on the side where equation numbering would be.
A: use a \begin{equation}
with \tag{\textasteriskcentered} (\dag, \ddag, etc) to give it a custom name

Q: How to do INTERNAL references (eg "by Ian's lemma") - I give them names or
something, right?
A: \label an equation, theorem, lemma etc. Then \ref to cite it.
\eqref to get parentheses around its name/number

Q: Tildes above symbols
A: \tilde or \widetilde (widetilde looks much better)

Q: left and right implication arrows (for proofs)
A: \Longleftarrow and \Longrightarrow (careful! They're math symbols)
for both ways there's \Longleftrightarrow = \iff

Q: generators / relations for groups <a,b|[a,b]>, etc
A: \langle and \rangle. Might want \mid in the middle instead of |

Q: how to give theorems custom names and use those (instead of "theorem 5",
because no one remembers what that is)
A: just put right after eg
\begin{thm}[Fermat's Last Theorem]

Q: isomorphisms?
A: \cong (GRR)
