\begin{abstract}

Given a Kleinian group $\Gamma$, one can ask whether the group contains any
quasifuchsian surface subgroups. Equivalently, given a pared 3-manifold
$(M,P)$, one can ask whether there exists a closed immersed $\pi_1$-injective
surface in $M$ that avoids the peripheral subgroups associated to $P$.  This is
known to be true for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and more generally for
finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We derive explicit results for pared
3-manifolds $(M,P)$ where $M$ is a book of $I$-bundles.

\section{Introduction}

Let $M$ be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold. $M$ can be realized as the
quotient manifold of a Kleinian group $\Gamma$. One can ask whether $\pi_1M$
contains any quasifuchsian surface subgroups. To tackle this problem
topologically, we represent a Kleinian group with a pared 3-manifold $(M,P)$.
The pared structure $P\cin\bd M$ specifies the boundary locus corresponding to
cusps of the parabolic group elements.

Finding a quasifuchsian surface subgroup of the Kleinian group boils down to
asking whether we can find a closed immersed $\pi_1$-injective surface which
avoids this pared locus up to homotopy. That is, we're trying to choose
a surface subgroup of $\pi_1M$ which does not contain any of the peripherial
subgroups associated to components of $P$. The general question is: for which
choices of $(M,P)$ can we find such a surface subgroup?

There is some existing work on this problem. Cooper-Long-Reid \cite{CLR}
addressed the underlying topological problem, showing that a compact connected
irreducible 3-manifold with non-empty incompressible boundary  must contain an
essential closed surface, unless it's covered by a product $F\times I$.
However, this surface may contain accidental parabolics, that is, overlap with
the pared locus $P$. If this occurs it will not be quasifuchsian.

% XXX something is wrong with Masters-Zhang citation / bib entry - I can only
% find their older paper (hyp knot complements) on mathscinet, not the full new
% one with link complements

In the closed case, there is the work of Kahn-Markovic \cite{KM}. They proved
that there always exists an immersed closed $\pi_1$-injective surface in any
closed hyperbolic 3-manifold.  Such a surface is necessarily quasifuchsian
because the surface is closed, so the pared structure is empty. Finally,
Masters-Zhang \cite{MZ} showed that every finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold
with cusps contains a quasifuchsian surface subgroup. An alternate proof was
provided by Baker-Cooper \cite{BC}.

The remaining case is infinite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. So far we've only
addressed a particular example of this case --- books of $I$-bundles. We
conjecture that all books of $I$-bundles admit quasifuchsian surface subgroups,
except for a few obvious negative cases where the pared locus is too large. We
prove this in a few special cases, so far.

% I'll figure out if I need the Fathi-Laudenbach-Poenaru stuff or not. Right now
% it looks like I don't, at least for the cases I've done so far. But it might
% come in handy later for more complicated pages? Not sure.

%\section{Surface background details}
%
%These are some background facts that we'll need to go through the examples in
%detail.
%
%Arcs in surfaces with boundary - from Fathi-Laudenback-Poenaru, Exposes 2 and
%4 (see p. 21-24, 43-52).
%This is an exposition of coordinates for classes of arcs in a surface
%with boundary, aka Dehn-Thurston coordinates.
%
%Let A(N) be the set of isotopy classe sof simple closed proper arcs I\in N such
%that they represent nontrivial elements of pi1 rel boundary. We isotope them
%with the ends of the arcs free to move within the boundary components they are
%contained in. Similarly A'(N) with simple closed multi-arcs, up to isotopy.
%
%Theorem (FLP 2.11). Let P2 be the standard pair of pants. A(P2) consists of
%exactly six elements, classified by the boundary components of their endpoints.
%
%Theorem (FLP 2.12). A'(P2) is isomorphic to
%A'={(a1,a2,a3) in Z | sum ai is even }
%via the map
%i:A'(P2)->A'
%i(tau) = (i(tau, d1),i(tau,d2),i(tau,d3)) where d1,d2,d3 are the boundary
%components of P2, and i(,) is geometric intersection number.
%
%That is, simple closed multicurves exist and are uniquely determined, for each
%choice of boundary intersection numbers of the correct parity.
%
%Finally, given a closed surface, let N, let S(N) be the set of isotopy classes
%of simple closed curves on N, and S'(N) simple closed multicurves.
%
%Theorem (FLP 4.8). Let N be a closed surface of negative Euler characteristic.
%Fix a pants decomposition of N into 2g-2 pairs of pants along 3g-3 disjoint
%simple closed curves K1,...,K3g-3. Then
%
%S'(N) is isomorphic to B0 = {(mi,si,ti) in Z, i = 1,...,3g-3 | all coords >= 0,
%and for each pair of pants the corresponding mi sum is even}
%where the mi measure intersection numbers with the curves K1,...,K3g-3, and the
%si,ti measure twisting around at each intersection curve as a rational number.
%See FLP for details of the calculation of the twisting coordinates - we won't
%be needing it here (at least, not yet!).
%
%We actually require a slight generalization of this result, but the proof is
%identical.
%
%Theorem. Let SA'(N) be the set of disjoint multi-curves or arcs on N, a surface
%possibly with boundary. That is, each element of SA'(N) corresponds to a union
%of simple closed curves and simple arcs on N, all disjoint, such that the arcs
%are properly embedded, up to isotopy where the arcs are permitted to slide on
%each boundary component. Then SA'(N) is isomorphic to the obvious choice, where
%we again decompose into pairs of pants, have mi for each boundary curve or
%decomposition curve, but si,ti only for each decomposition curve.
%
%Finally, let A''(N) (or maybe some better notation, etc) be the set of simple
%proper multi-arcs satisfying the condition that no two components of the
%multi-arc are parallel, ie, isotopic. Alternatively we can think of A''(N) as
%consisting of simplices in the arc complex of N, or as a quotient of A'(N)
%where we identify multicurves along splitting / joining of parallel arcs. In
%general, A''(N) is more difficult to parametrize, as purely from the
%coordinates it is difficult to determine which multicurves or multiarcs will
%contain parallel components.
%
%We define S''(N), SA''(N) similarly.
%
%Example. Consider the pair of pants P2. We know A(P2) has 6 elements, so
%A''(P2) has at most 2**6 elements, corresponding to which arcs are present in
%our multi-arc. It suffices to check that all 6 arcs can be
%embedded in P2 without intersecting.
%
%Example. Consider the punctured torus \Si_{1,}. We first compute SA'(\Si_{1,1}). By the
%generalized Dehn-Thurston coordinates theorem above, (work this out on paper
%first)

\begin{Def}

A \emph{pared manifold} $(M,P)$ is a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold
$M$, together with $P\cin\bd M$, such that the following conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every component of $P$ is a torus or annulus, incompressible in $M$.

\item Every noncyclic abelian subgroup of $\pi_1M$ is peripheral with respect
to $P$ -- ie, conjugate to the fundamental group of a component of $P$.

\item $(M,P)$ is ``annulus-incompressible'': every $\pi_1$-injective map $(A^2,
\bd A^2) \to (M,P)$ is homotopic (as a map of pairs) to a map into $P$.

\end{enumerate}

We call $P$ the \emph{pared locus} or \emph{parabolic locus} of the pared
manifold $(M,P)$.

\end{Def}

Note that there are a few pared manifolds that are special cases, like with
elementary Kleinian groups. In fact, these are precisely the pared manifolds
that correspond to elementary Kleinian groups when we construct pared
3-manifolds from Kleinian groups below.

%(Canary-McCullough p88)
\begin{Def}

A pared manifold $(M,P)$ is \emph{elementary} if it is homeomorphic (as a pair)
to one of the following: $(T^2\x I,T^2\x 0)$, $(A^2\x I,A^2\x 0)$, or $(A^2\x
I,\emptyset)$.
%(or (Morgan only) (S3,empty)).

\end{Def}

%(Morgan p59, Canary-McCullough p88)
\begin{prop}

Let $(M,P)$ nonelementary. The following facts hold:

%In fact, Canary-McCullough makes these 3 statements. Morgan only has the 4th.
\begin{enumerate}
\item M is not a $T^2\x I$, $K^2$ $I$-bundle, or $A^2\x I$ (solid torus).
\item M does not contain an embedded $K^2$
\item For every component $Q$ of $P$, $\pi_1Q$ is a maximal abelian subgroup of
$\pi_1M$.
\item Every component of $\bd M-P$ has negative Euler characteristic.
% Yes this is correct. But the only extra info we get is that there's no
% parallel annuli. Canary-McCullough includes the statement:
% "Every toroidal component of dM is contained in P"
% but this is redundant with item 4 above (from Morgan)
\end{enumerate}

\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
See \cite{CMc} or \cite{Mo}.
\end{proof}

Pared manifolds arise naturally in the study of Kleinian groups. Given
a geometrically finite torsion-free Kleinian group $G$, we construct $(M,P)$ by
truncating small neighborhoods of the cusps of the quotient manifold $M(G)
= \left(\mathbb{H}^3\cup \Om(G)\right)/G$.  Then we let $M$ be the resulting
compact manifold with boundary, and $P$ the boundary locus along which we
truncated.  That is, we can rebuild the quotient manifold from $(M,P)$ by
gluing cusp neighborhoods onto each component of $P$. It follows from basic
Kleinian group theory that the resulting $(M,P)$ will satisfy conditions 1-3
above, making it a pared manifold.  The parabolic elements of $G$ precisely
correspond to (conjugacy classes of) the peripheral subgroups $\pi_1P$ in
$\pi_1M$.

Conversely, Thurston's famous uniformization theorem states that for every
pared manifold $(M,P)$ with $M$ Haken, there exists a finite volume (in
particular, geometrically finite) hyperbolic 3-manifold structure on the
interior satisfying the appropriate conditions for a pared 3-manifold! To be
precise:

%(see Morgan for details of this construction)

%(Morgan p60, but his statement is confusing / less modern definitions. He does
%state the more general theorem for Haken pared manifolds though.)
%(Canary-McCullough p105-106)

\begin{thm}

If $(M,P)$ is an oriented pared 3-manifold with nonempty boundary, then
there exists a geometrically finite uniformization of $(M,P)$, that is, a map
$\rho: \pi_1M \to \mbox{\rm{PSL}}_2\mathbb{C}$ such that $\rho(g)$ is parabolic
if $g \in \pi_1(P)$, and an orientation-preserving homeomorphism $M-P \to
\left(\mathbb{H}^3 \cup \Om(\rho(\pi_1M))\right)/\rho(\pi_1M)$.

\end{thm}
\begin{proof}

See \cite{CMc}.
Also see discussion on (CMc p106, bottom of page) for why this definition of
geometrically finite is equivalent to the standard one.

\end{proof}

% Example. Maybe? XXX TODO

\section{Our reduction}

In our result, we study the problem of finding quasifuchsian surface subgroups
of finitely generated Kleinian groups from the topological perspective. We
convert our given Kleinian group to a pared 3-manifold, and look for surface
subgroups of this Kleinian group that avoid the peripheral pared structure. We
can reduce the problem of finding a quasifuchsian surface subgroup of
a Kleinian group as follows.

We first restrict ourselves to considering only Kleinian groups which are
geometrically finite. In the geometrically infinite case, look at the simply
degenerate (geometrically infinite) ends of the group. By the Canary covering
theorem, tameness, and some other results, it's known that any finitely
generated subgroup of a Kleinian group must be either geometrically finite or
a virtual surface fiber - that is, it corresponds to a fiber surface in
a finite-sheeted cover which is fibered over the circle. See (AFW p117) for
this fact and various spots in the book for arguments.

% No virtual surface fiber subgroup can possibly be quasifuchsian, 

Only geometrically finite subgroups can be quasifuchsian. This is basically by
definition (check this). The problematic case is when it's possible to have
a geometrically finite quasifuchsian surface subgroup of a geometrically
infinite Kleinian group. Looking at the simply degenerate ends, and comparing
to the ends of the quasifuchsian surface subgroup itself (viewed as a Kleinian
group), the relative ends must finite-to-one cover relative ends of the
original Kleinian group, by the Canary covering theorem. But now there's some
problem with different types of (relative) ends covering different types of
ends. I still don't understand this.

Also, note that quasifuchsian here is intended in the sense of Kahn-Markovic as
discussed in AFW p81. As discussed there (will get references), quasifuchsian
surface subgroups must be geometrically finite - which rules out the virtual
fiber case by the above dichotomy - and directly correspond to geometrically
finite subgroups that avoid the cusps.

One final consideration is to ensure that geometrically finite surface
subgroups cannot exhibit certain pathological behavior inside geometrically
infinite Kleinian groups. In the geometrically finite case this is easy,
because it'll necessarily also be geometrically finite, but in the
geometrically infinite case we need to either guarantee that the surface we
find by the below, purely topological construction is geometrically finite, or
show that actually no such surface exists and our construction is irrelevant.
Check with Ian (and references) about which of these we're actually doing!

Of course, so long as we are only studying books of I-bundles topologically,
this is irrelevant, as we can restrict ourselves to considering the
geometrically finite realizations of these hyperbolic 3-manifolds. However, it
is nice to be able to state the result more generally. Also if we want to
generalize to a more complete consideration of (finitely generated) Kleinian
groups at some point, not just books of I-bundles, it will be nice to say that
our work applies to more than just geometrically finite cases.

Anyway, I believe the geometrically infinite case is much simpler once
I understand what existing work it's based on. I'll need to talk to Ian about
this. In what follows, just assume our Kleinian group is geometrically finite.

% OLD REFERENCE - DOESN'T WORK BY ITSELF!
%%(Baker-Cooper Theorem 1.7 - "work of Bonahon and Thurston").
%\begin{thm}
%
%Let $M$ be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with finite volume, and $S$
%a closed oriented $\pi_1$-injective immersed surface of negative Euler
%characteristic. Then either $S$ is a virtual fiber, or $S$ is geometrically
%finite. In the second case, it's either quasifuchsian or some element of
%$\pi_1S$ is parabolic.
%
%\end{thm}
%

We assume this reduction still works in our cases (which are not finite
volume). I hope some reference can fix this! TODO

So in our case, since the parabolic elements precisely correspond to the pared
structure, our problem becomes a purely topological one: can we find a closed
immersed $\pi_1$-injective surface of negative Euler characteristic, that
doesn't contain any of the pared locus, up to homotopy?

Since we're working in the case of books of $I$-bundles, we can reduce the
pared locus by observing that there are no torus boundary components of M, so
all the components of the pared locus must be annuli (as they're
$\pi_1$-injective). For each annulus, since we're only concerned with its
homotopy class, it suffices to consider the core curve.

\section{Our first example}

We construct a book of $I$-bundles $M$ as follows. In the following we take
$\Si_{1,1}$ to be the compact surface of genus 1 with a single boundary
component, a circle. Let $M_1$,$M_2$,$M_3$ be 3 punctured torus $I$-bundles,
$M_1=M_2=M_3=\Si_{1,1}\x I$. For each $M_i$, write \[ \bd M_i = \bd \Si_{1,1}\x
I \cup \Si_{1,1}\x0 \cup \Si_{1,1} \x 1 \] and label these boundary pieces as
\[ \bd M_i = A_i \cup \bd_- M_i \cup \bd_+M_i \].

Let $M_c = S^1xD^2$ be a solid torus. Attach the $M_i$ to $M_c$ by gluing the
$A_i$ to parallel annuli in $\bd M_c$, each with longitudinal core curve. The
result is a compact 3-manifold with boundary. This is our $M$. We choose
orientations and a cyclic order for the gluing such that the 3 boundary
components of M are precisely
\[
\bd M = (\bd_+M_1 \cup_{S^1} \bd_-M_2) \sqcup (\bd_+M_2 \cup_{S^1} \bd_-M_3)
\sqcup (\bd_+M_3 \cup_{S^1} \bd_-M_1)
\]
and label these
\[
\bd M=\bd_{12}M \sqcup \bd_{23}M \sqcup \bd_{31}M
\].
Each boundary
component of $M$ consists of two punctured tori glued along their boundary
circles, topologically a genus two surface.

We consider possible pared structures $P$ on $M$. Our goal is to find
a surface $S \cin M$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{E:qf}
S \text{ is closed immersed $\pi_1$-injective, and  $\pi_1P_k \cap \pi_1S
= 1$
for each component $P_k$ of $P$} \tag{\textasteriskcentered}
\end{equation}

% XXX straighten this out
%Note that since we
%haven't fixed a basepoint, these subgroups are really only defined up to
%conjugacy - what we're saying is they fail to intersect for an arbitrary choice
%of conjugacy class for each subgroup. (ask Ian about this? seems fuzzy)

\begin{lemma}\label{L:sc}

Let $S$ be a surface satisfying \eqref{E:qf}. Homotope $S$ to have minimal
intersection with each $A_i$, that is, so there are no ``bumps''.  Then for
each $M_i$, each component of $S \cap M_i$ is a finite-sheeted covering of the
core surface.  That is, given such a component $S' \cin M_i$, the map $S' \to
M_i = \Si_{1,1}\x I \to \Si_{1,1}\x{1/2}$ is homotopic to a finite-sheeted
covering map. Conversely, given any finite-sheeted covering $\widetilde{S} \to
\Si_{1,1}$, there exists a corresponding proper immersed $\pi_1$-injective
surface $S \cin \Si_{1,1}\x I$.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

$S$ is compact, so every such component $S'$ is a compact surface with
boundary, properly immersed in $M_i$. Since $S$ is $\pi_1$-injective in $M$,
$S'$ must be $\pi_1$-injective in $M_i$. Otherwise, we'd have a nontrivial
element of $\pi_1S'$ which is trivial in $\pi_1M_i$, hence in $\pi_1M$, hence
in $\pi_1S$, contradicting the minimal position homotopy above. So the map
$\phi : S'\to\Si_{1,1}\x{1,2}$ is also $\pi_1$-injective, since $M_i$
deformation retracts to its core. Let $H = \phi_*(\pi_1S')$, and let
$\Si_{1,1}^H$ be the cover of $\Si_{1,1}$ associated to $H<\pi_1\Si_{1,1}$.
$\phi$ lifts to $\widetilde{\phi}\colon S'\to \Si_{1,1}^H$. This is a proper
map of compact surfaces which is an isomorphism on $\pi_1$.  By the
classification of surfaces, it must be homotopic (as a proper map) to
a homeomorphism. So $\phi$ is homotopic to a covering map. It must be
finite-sheeted as $S'$ is compact (by classification of surfaces again).

Conversely, given a finite-sheeted cover $\widetilde{S}\to \Si_{1,1}$, compose
with the embedding $\Si_{1,1} = \Si_{1,1}\x{1/2} \cin \Si_{1,1}\x I$. This is
proper and $\pi_1$-injective.  Perturb locally to obtain an immersion.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}

Let $P$ be a pared structure on $M$. $P$ cannot contain any tori. That is,
$P$ consists entirely of annuli.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

We can compute $\pi_1M$ directly from the van Kampen theorem. Let $a_i,b_i$ be
the generators of $\pi_1(M_i)$, and $c$ be the generator of $\pi_1(M_c)$. Our
gluing yields
\[
\pi_1(M) = \langle a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3,c \mid
[a_1,b_1]=[a_2,b_2]=[a_3,b_3]=c \rangle
\]
It immediately follows that $\pi_1M$ contains no rank 2 abelian subgroups, as
no two elements commute. Since every component of $P$ is $\pi_1$-injective,
they must all be annuli.

Alternatively, simply observe that all the boundary components of $M$ have
negative Euler characteristic, so they don't admit $\pi_1$-injective maps from
a torus.

\end{proof}

\begin{prop}

Suppose $P$ contains a component $P_0$ that, up to homotopy, is contained
entirely within one ``$I$-bundle half'' of a boundary component. That is, $P_0
\cin \bd M_i$, for some i. Without loss of generality we can let $P_0 \cin \bd
M_1$.  Then there exists a surface satisfying \eqref{E:qf} if and only if $P$
contains no components that are (up to homotopy) contained in $\bd M_2 \cup \bd
M_3 = \bd_-M_2 \sqcup \bd_{23}M \sqcup \bd_+M_3$.

\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

($\Longleftarrow$) Take $S=\bd_{23}M$. Intuitively, it's easy to see that the
conditions on $P$ force all its components to lie on surfaces where they can't
be homotoped into $S$.

Algebraically, $\pi_1S$ is the subgroup generated by $a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3 \in
\pi_1M$. We know that
\[
\pi_1S = \langle a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3 \mid [a_2,b_2]=[a_3,b_3]\rangle.
\]
$P$ contains no components in $\bd_{23}M$, so an arbitrary component $P_k$ of
$P$ must be contained in $\bd_{12}M$ or $\bd_{31}M$, which have fundamental
groups generated by $a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2$ and $a_3,b_3,a_1,b_1$ respectively.
$\pi_1P_k$ is cyclic, so let $g$ be its generator. No matter if it's contained
in $\bd_{12}M$ or $\bd_{31}M$, we can see that in order for $\pi_1P_k$ to
overlap with $\pi_1S$, it must have generator some word in $a_2,b_2$ (if $P_k
in \bd_{12}M$), or some word in $a_3,b_3$ (if $P_k in \bd_{31}M$). In either
case, this is precisely the condition for such a word to correspond to a curve
contained in $\bd M_2$ or $\bd M_3$, respectively, contradicting our assumption
on $P$.

($\Longrightarrow$) Let $S$ be a surface satisfying \eqref{E:qf}. Cut $S$ into
components in $M_1,M_2,M_3$ (after homotoping to minimal intersections with the
annuli).  Applying Lemma~\ref{L:sc}, we can see that $S \cap M_1 = \emptyset$,
as otherwise since it's a finite-sheeted cover it would have to contain
a multiple of $P_0$.  So $S \cin M_2 \cup M_3 \cup M_c$, which is homeomorphic
to $S_2 \x I$.  Deformation retracting this to a surface $S_2$ and applying
a covering argument like in Lemma~\ref{L:sc}, we can see that $S$ is a cover of
$S_2$.  Since it's a finite-sheeted cover, it will have to have $\pi_1$
intersecting any component $P_k$ that violates the conditions stated above.
This completes the proof.

\end{proof}

The proof above obviously generalizes to more complex books of $I$-bundles.
Later we'll use it to simplify any pared structures containing annuli that fit
in a single $I$-bundle.

\begin{thm}\label{T:ex1}

Let $P$ be a pared structure containing no components $P_0$ as in the above
proposition. Then there exists a surface satisfying \eqref{E:qf}.

\end{thm}

This is the main theorem we prove for this example. A few preliminary facts are
required. Note that we can first isotope P such that it's in minimal position
on each boundary component with respect to the gluing circle.

\begin{lemma}

Under the hypotheses of the theorem, each ``$I$-bundle piece'' boundary
component $S=\bd_\pm M_i$ intersects $P$ in a thickened set of disjoint
essential arcs, each arc connecting $\bd S$ to itself. The arcs form at most
3 ``bands'', where all the arcs in each band are parallel.  Furthermore, if we
choose a representative arc from each band (yielding a set of at most
3 disjoint non-parallel arcs in $\Si_{1,1}$), there exists an automorphism of
$\Si_{1,1}$ taking these arcs to a standard set of 3 disjoint non-parallel
arcs.  See diagram for an illustration of the standard set.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

We first need a preliminary definition. After cutting a surface with boundary
along arcs, we'll obtain one or more connected surfaces, each with one or more
boundary components. Each boundary component after cutting will have pieces
from the original boundary as well as pieces from the arcs that we cut along.
Given labels $\gamma_1,...,\gamma_k$ for the boundary components and
$\alpha_1,...,\alpha_l$ for the arcs (on the original surface with boundary),
we can describe each boundary component of the cut surfaces as a union of arcs,
each labeled with $\gamma_1,...,\gamma_k,\alpha_1,...,\alpha_l$. We call this
an \emph{arc pattern} for that boundary component of the new surface.

We first show that $\Si_{1,1}$ admitts at most 3 disjoint essential
non-parallel arcs, and the possible surfaces and arc patterns obtained by
cutting along these arcs are very restricted.

Label the boundary component of $\Si_{1,1}$ by $\gamma$. Consider a proper
essential arc $\alpha_1 \cin \Si_{1,1}$. Fix an orientation for $\alpha_1$.
Since $\Si_{1,1}$ is orientable, we can look at local neighborhoods of
$\alpha_1$ and see that $\alpha_1$ has a well-defined ``left side'' and ``right
side'' as we travel along it. Looking at the endpoints of $\alpha_1$ along
$\gamma$, we are forced to connect certain endpoints in the cut-up $\gamma$
with $\alpha_1$, in order to preserve the parity. This tells us the (possibly
disconnected) cut surface $S_1$ will have two boundary components. Each will
have an arc pattern consisting of two arcs, one labeled $\gamma$ and one
labeled $\alpha_1$.

Since we cut along a properly embedded arc, the Euler characteristic increases
by one. $\chi(S_1)=0$ and $S_1$ has two boundary components. By classification
of surfaces, $S_1 = \Si_{0,2}$ or $\Si_{0,1} \sqcup \Si_{1,1}$. But if $S_1$
contained a disk with the arc pattern described above, embedding that disk back
in $\Si_{1,1}$ would describe a homotopy of $\alpha_1$ into the boundary. So
$S_1 = \Si_{0,2}$.

Now suppose we had a second proper essential arc $\alpha_2 \cin \Si_{1,1}$,
disjoint from and non-parallel to $\alpha_1$. Since it's disjoint from
$\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$ induces a proper arc in $S_1$ which connects two regions
in the arc pattern labeled $\gamma$.  $\alpha_2$ must have one endpoint on each
boundary component of $S_1$. If both are on the same side, it's either
homotopic to the boundary of $\Si_{1,1}$ or parallel to $\alpha_1$. Cutting
along $\alpha_2$ yields a new surface $S_2$. Topologically $S_2=D^2$, with arc
pattern consisting of 8 components in the cyclic order
$(\gamma,\alpha_1,\gamma,\alpha_2,\gamma,\alpha_1,\gamma,\alpha_2)$.

Finally, adding our 3rd proper essential arc $\alpha_3$, disjoint and
non-parallel to the first two arcs, a similar argument shows that $\alpha_3$
must connect opposite $\gamma$ pieces in the arc pattern. Cutting along
$\alpha_3$ yields two disks with the same arc pattern. Depending on the choice
of $\alpha_3$, the arc pattern on these disks is either
$(\gamma,\alpha_1,\gamma,\alpha_2,\gamma,\alpha_3)$ or
$(\gamma,\alpha_1,\gamma,\alpha_3,\gamma,\alpha_2)$. So up to relabeling
$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3$, cutting along 3 proper essential disjoint
non-parallel arcs has only one possible choice of cut surfaces and arc
patterns.

Observe that it is not possible to add any more disjoint non-parallel arcs. In
particular, any arc we draw between $\gamma$ components of the arc pattern on
either disk is homotopic to the boundary or parallel to an existing arc.
Furthermore, if we add new disjoint arcs and allow them to be parallel, we can
see that they must form ``bands'' around the existing 3 arcs in order to remain
disjoint. That is, we can homotope all the arcs parallel to a given arc into
a small neighborhood of that arc in the disk, without intersecting any of the
non-parallel arcs.

We claim there exists an automorphism of $\Si_{1,1}$ taking any set of 3 such
arcs to any other set (in particular, to the standard set, as illustrated).
Since there is only one topological result of cutting along the arcs, choose
a homeomorphism of the cut surfaces. Up to relabeling the arcs, we can choose
a homeomorphism that identifies matching arcs in the arc patterns (as shown
above, there is only one possible arc pattern up to relabeling). Glue both
sides along the arcs to obtain the desired automorphism of $\Si_{1,1}$.

We now consider $P \cap \bd_S \cin S \cong \Si_{1,1}$. As shown, $P$ is a union
of annuli. By the assumptions of the theorem, no annulus of $P$ is contained in
$S$, so each annulus intersects $S$ in a union of rectangles, where two sides
of the rectangle are embedded in the boundary $\bd S$.  Since we homotoped $P$
to have minimal intersections, all the core arcs of the rectangles (pieces of
the core curve of the annulus) must be essential. They are disjoint by
definition of $P$. The statement of the lemma follows from applying the above
argument to these core arcs.

\end{proof}

We consider connected double covers $\widetilde{S} \to S \cong \Si_{1,1}$.
These covers have 2 boundary components. Every core arc of $P \cap S$ lifts to
2 arcs in $\widetilde{S}$.  We say an arc in $S$ is \emph{cis} for a given
$\widetilde{S}$ if any (ie all) lifts of that arc have both endpoints in the
same boundary component of $\widetilde{S}$.  Otherwise, we say it's
\emph{trans} for that cover.

\begin{lemma}

Given any 3 disjoint non-parallel proper arcs in $\Si_{1,1}$, and any double
cover of $\Si_{1,1}$, 2 of the 3 arcs are trans, and the 3rd is cis.
Furthermore, we can choose any two of the three we wish to be trans with an
appropriate cover.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

As in earlier lemma, there exists an automorphism of $\Si_{1,1}$ taking these
arcs to the standard set of 3 disjoint non-parallel proper arcs.  Now it
suffices to observe, by looking at relative first homology or just by
construction, that each of the three standard connected double covers
(corresponding to nontrivial maps $\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}/2$) makes two of
the three arcs trans and the third cis.

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{T:ex1}]

Since $P$ has no components $P_0$, every $P \cap \bd_+M_i$ is a union of
thickened arcs (that is, there are no full annulus components in any $\bd_+M_i$
or $\bd_-M_i$). Apply the first lemma to break these into bands. The problem is
most constrained when there are 3 bands, so we'll consider that case (if there
are fewer than 3, just draw some more arcs on that component arbitrarily, and
the proof still works).

We will build our surface $S$ by taking a double cover of the core $\Si_{1,1}$
surface for each $I$-bundle page $M_1,M_2,M_3$. Call these covers
$S_1,S_2,S_3$.  Each of these has two boundary components. We'll then attach
the boundary components such that each of $S_1,S_2,S_3$ has exactly one
boundary component connected to each of the others. See diagram.

Choose an arbitrary connected double cover for $S_1$. We can view this as
a cover of $\bd_+M_1$ or $\bd_-M_1$, deformation retracting either way. By the
lemma, two of the
3 bands on $\bd_+M_1$ are trans, and the other is cis. The same holds for
  $\bd_-M_1$.

We cannot choose $S_2$ arbitrarily, as a cis arc for $S_1$ in $\bd_+M_1$ may
connect (in $S$) to a cis arc for $S_2$ in $\bd_-M_2$. These together would
form a closed curve that lifts to $S$, which once $S$ is immersed in $M$ will
yield a violation of condition \eqref{E:qf}. Instead, observe that there is at
most one band of the three in $\bd_-M_2$ containing arcs that, when glued
across the core circle, match up to arcs in the cis band of $\bd_+M_1$ to form
closed curves containing only arcs in those two bands. This is because once one
band has that behavior, by endpoint parity the vertices can't also match up for
a different band, if the arcs they have to match with on the other side are
parallel. Looking at the boundary circle, non-parallel arcs have endpoints in
cyclic order, but parallel arcs don't. See diagram. It suffices to check this
for our standard set of non-parallel arcs, by the same automorphism argument.

Since there is only one such band on $\bd_-M_2$, choose $S_2$ such that this
band is not cis.  Finally, for $S_3$ we have two connecting constraints. We
have a cis band on $\bd_-M_1$ from our choice of $S_1$, and a cis band on
$\bd_+M_2$ from our choice of $S_2$.  Applying the same argument, there is at
most one band on $\bd_-M_3$ and one band on $\bd_+M_3$ that will connect to
form closed curves. But we can choose $S_3$ such that both of these bands are
trans. (This requires a slight modification to the lemma - since these bands
are on different boundary surfaces, they may not be disjoint non-parallel. If
they aren't disjoint, we can tweak them by local modifications so they are, and
then ``untweak'' them in the cover. If they are parallel, just ignore one set
of bands)

Glue $S_1,S_2,S_3$ as described to obtain $S$. We claim that $S$ satisfies
condition \eqref{E:qf}. $S$ is closed and immersed by construction (as in
Lemma~\ref{L:sc}). It is $\pi_1$-injective inside each $I$-bundle by
Lemma~\ref{L:sc}, and inside the core $M_c$ because it's just a union of
incompressible gluing annuli there. It suffices to show that $\pi_1S \cap
\pi_1P_k = 1$ for each component $P_k$ of the pared locus. Looking at the core
curve of the annulus $P_k$, this implies that some multiple of that core curve
is homotopic into $S$.

But this is impossibly by the above construction. Every such curve contains at
least two bands, on two different components $\bd_\pm M_i$. By the construction
of $S$, of any two bands which connect up when the boundary components are
glued across circles, at least one must be trans. This means that when we try
to homotope the core curve multiple into $S$, in order to follow along $S$
locally (in each page, where $S$ is locally a cover of the core surface, it
must be a lift from that core surface) it would have to traverse between all
three pieces of the cover, as that's how we connected up the $Si$. Every trans
arc lifts to an arc that connects two different boundary components of an $Si$,
which are ``pointed in different directions.'' But this is obviously
impossible, as our $P_k$ is restricted to be in a single boundary component, so
up to homotopy it must be generated by those two $I$-bundle pages only.

\end{proof}

\section{General case - preliminaries}

We prove a generalization of the above example. Basically, we want to first
identify the cases that obviously can't have a surface satisfying (*). Then
we'll prove by construction that every other book of I-bundles does in fact
contain such a surface.

We use the following general notation for books of $I$-bundles. Let
$M_{c1},...,M_{cm}$ be the spines, all solid tori. Let $M_1,...,M_n$ be the
pages, all thickened surfaces. Each $M_i$ has boundary components
$A_{i1},...,A_{ik_i}$ all annuli. We glue each annulus by a homeomorphism phiij
to a boundary annulus Aij' some dMck. Note that Aij' might not be a simple
longitude of, that is, a page can wrap multiple times around a spine. For each
spine, we require all these Aij' to be disjoint parallel incompressible.  If
$M$ is a nonelementary Kleinian manifold with incompressible boundary, we can
assume without loss of generality that all pages have negative Euler
characteristic, and all spines have at least 3 pages glued to them.

To see this, observe that each page which is a copy of S0,1 means that that
page and its attaching spine form a 3-manifold with a finite-sheeted cover by
a ball (we can arrange things so that in the cover, the S0,1 attaching map only
traverses the longitude once, and we get a thickened disk). This means that
we'll have finite order summands in our Kleinian group, which is impossible as
it's torsion free. Or some argument with JSJ decomposition having elliptic
piece? Either way, this can't happen with the manifolds we care about.

If we have a spine with only a single page attached, we can pass to
a finite-sheeted cover and obtain a boundary compression, so this case can't
occur (?). Begin with a meridian disk of the spine.  This intersects the page's
attaching curve in a single point, since we passed to an appropriate cover. Now
... something. % TODO figure this out.

Finally, for any spine with 2 pages attached, we can simplify the book of
I-bundles structure by attaching the 2 pages along their boundary annuli to
make a single larger page. This is homeomorphic to the original manifold.
Similarly, for any S0,2 page, we can glue the two spine boundaries together
along that page's gluing curves to make a single spine. The other attached
pages of each spine will be carried along by the gluing to form a single set of
attached pages which is the union of the two original sets, minus the S0,2
page.

We also want to clarify the possible gluing annuli on the spines. Given a solid
torus boundary curve (l,m) that travels m times around a meridian and l times
around a longitude, we can ask whether it is permissible to glue a page along
an annulus parallel to this curve. Obviously if we glue our pages along
meridian curves (0,1), we'll have a boundary compression along a parallel
meridian disk.

% I believe all other possibilities are ok, as long as we don't violate the
% one-point intersection constraint Ian mentioned.

Lemma ("One-point intersection lemma").

Consider a solid torus, or more generally a handlebody, with a collection of
I-bundles glued to it along annuli. The resulting manifold has a boundary
compression iff there exists a meridian disk that intersects the boundary
gluing curves exactly once.

Proof.

Not immediately obvious. Use some cut and paste topology? % TODO

Anyway, now we have a general book of I-bundles. Observe first that the pared
locus P must be a union of annuli, just as in the specific example above.  Now
there are a number of topological simplifications we make, by passing to an
appropriate finite-sheeted cover of the book of I-bundles.  Once we can
construct a surface satisfying (*) inside this cover, we can push it down and
perturb slightly to obtain a surface satisfying (*) downstairs (since it
pi1-injects into a subgroup, it will definitely still be pi1-injective).

We pass to a book of I-bundles satisfying the following conditions:

(0) M has incompressible boundary, every page core surface has negative Euler
characteristic, and every spine has at least 3 gluing annuli.

(1) Each page is glued to a given spine at most once.

(2) Each gluing annulus on a spine is parallel to a simple longitude, and each
page is an oriented surface.

Lemma.

Let M be a nonelementary Kleinian manifold which is a book of I-bundles with
incompressible boundary. Then M has a finite-sheeted cover satisfying (1) and
(2).

Proof.

We use subgroup separability. Look at Long-Reid, fill in details here.

\section{Main theorem}

Suppose we have a book of I-bundles satisfying (1) and (2).

Theorem.

Let M be a book of I-bundles Kleinian manifold with incompressible boundary
satisfying (0), (1) and (2). Suppose further that no components of the
parabolic locus P are contained in a single page's boundary. Then M contains
a surface satisfying (*).

Proof.

This is the main proof, and is quite involved. We proceed somewhat similarly to
the first example. We take covers over the pages and glue them together
cleverly to construct our surface. We check that the parabolic locus arcs on
each page lift to arcs on these covers that do not connect up to form a closed
curve. As in the first example, this suffices to prove that our surface
satisfies (*). We first need to take the correct cover over each page.

Lemma.

Let S be a compact surface with boundary, and P a finite set of proper arcs on
S (not necessarily disjoint).  Then there exists a finite-sheeted cover S' of
S such that the preimage pi-1(P) consists of arcs each of which connects
2 different boundary components of S'.

Proof.

Subgroup separability again. Do one at a time, with the eyeglasses trick.  Look
up and fill in.

Proof of Theorem:

Consider an arbitrary boundary component Sa of the book of I-bundles M.
Cutting M along the gluing annuli decomposes daM into a union of pieces each of
which is one side of an I-bundle page. Call these pieces Sa,k. Then the page is
Sa,kxI, with the piece embedded as Sa,kx0 or Sa,kx1. Without loss of generality
let it be Sa,kx0. We can look at the pattern of arcs Pa,k = P cap (Sa,kx0) on
that side of the page, which is part of daM. We can also look at the pattern of
arcs on the opposite side of the page barPa,k = P cap (Sa,kx1), and temporarily
view it as living inside Sa,k (flattening Sa,kxI -> Sa,k).  For each piece,
apply the lemma above to (Sa,k,Pa,k cup barPa,k) to obtain a cover S'a,k. If we
view this as a cover of Sa,kx0 and Sa,kx1, it has the property that any arc in
Pa,k or barPa,k lifts to an arc connecting two different boundary components of
S'a,k.

Let da,k be the degree of this cover. Let d = lcm a,k da,k.

Fix some large integer n>0. Now for each k, let pia,k : tildeSa,k -> S'a,k ->
Sa,k be a disjoint union of n*d/da,k copies of S'a,k. The purpose of the d/da,k
normalization is to make sure each pia,k is a cover of the same degree, n*d.
We'll call the disjoint components of this cover "pieces". We can also combine
these into a single cover pi : sqcup tildeSa,k -> sqcup Sa,k

Each Sa,k is homeomorphic to the core surface of its page, so by the covering
lemma any closed surface formed by gluing the tildeSa,k along appropriate
boundaries will induce an immersed pi1-injective surface in M. This is our
strategy.

Write tildePa,k=pia,k-1(Pa,k). As constructed, Pa,k consists of proper arcs
connecting two different boundary components of tildeSa,k.

We first glue the pieces "along" daM in the following sense. Given any two
pieces Sa,k1, Sa,k2 in the decomposition of daM, we know that Sa,k1 has some
boundary components gamma1,gamma2,dots cin dSa,k1, and gamma1',gamma2',dots cin
dSa,k2 such that before we cut daM apart, gamma1 was glued to gamma1', gamma2
to gamma2', etc.  That is, these components form the locus we glue Sa,k1 and
Sa,k2 together along when we glue the Sa,k to form daM.  For each such pair,
look at the boundary components of tildeSa,k1 and tildeSa,k2.  We allow
ourselves to glue components of pi-1(gamma1) to components of pi-1(gamma1'),
components of pi-1(gamma2) to components of pi-1(gamma2'), etc. We forbid
ourselves from gluing components of pi-1(gamma1) to any other lifted boundary
components of Sa,k2 or of any other pieces. Only on the very last step of our
construction will we break this rule.

Note that since our gluing is locally a cover we can only glue each pair of
boundary components upstairs in one possible way - we could choose a different
gluing, but this would just correspond to a different choice of cover by the
covering lemma.

We introduce some notation. Bbegin by taking tildeS(0) = sqcup tildeSa,k to be
a disjoint union of these covers - that is, we haven't done any gluing yet. At
each step in the gluing, we have a gluing map f(i+1) : tildeS(i) -> tildeS(i+1)
by attaching two boundary comonents of tildeS(i). Write tildeP(i) for the arcs
and curves on tildeS(i) induced by gluing the tildePa,k. That is, tildeP(i)
= f(i) circ ...  circ f(1) (sqcup tildePa,k).

However, we do not want to do this gluing arbitrarily.  In addition to gluing
along daM, we want to preserve the following invariant.

(dag) Each tildeP(i) cin tildeS(i) does not contain any closed curves. That is,
it forms a union of proper arcs.

% XXX I don't think we need this:  which each start and end at *different*
% boundary components of tildeSa.
%
% The trick is we can fix it with the subgroup separability trick on the OTHER
% colors (!!)

By the use of the lemma and the assumption of the theorem (no closed curves in
individual pages), tildeS(0) satisfies (dag).  We repeatedly make an arbitrary
gluing that's along daM in the above sense and that preserves (dag).  This
process will terminate at some point, after there are no more gluings left to
make that preserve (dag). We'll call this surface tildeS, and by abuse of
terminology, we'll call the images of the S'a,k pieces of tildeS also. tildeS
is a surface with boundary, because there are "leftover" boundary components
that we couldn't glue without violating (dag).

Claim.

tildeS has a number of boundary components bounded by C(M,P,Sa). In particular,
this bound is independent of the choice of n.

Proof of Claim.

Consider an arbitrary boundary component tildegamma cin dtildeS.  It lives
above some boundary component gamma cin dSa,k. Look at the number of arcs of
Pa,k which are incident to gamma. This number depends only on M and P (not on
n). Let i(M,P,Sa) be the maximum such number of incident arcs of P for any
boundary component gamma of any Sa,k in Sa. Let j(M,P,Sa) be the total number
of boundary components of the Sa,k.

Let gamma' cin dSa,k' be the boundary component matching gamma. We can glue
gamma along M to any boundary component of tildeS above gamma'. If tildeS has
boundary components above gamma', the only reason we'd be unable to glue to
tildegamma is if there were arcs between tildegamma and all the
tildegamma'1,...tildegamma'l leftover components of tildeS above gamma'.  This
is the only way that an additional gluing would violate (dag).

But since tildeS is locally a cover on each piece, the number of arcs incident
to gamma is bounded by i(M,P,Sa). Tracing these arcs through tildeS, they can
hit at most i(M,P,Sa) other boundary components. So tildeS can have at most
i(M,P,Sa) many boundary components above gamma'. But since tildeS(0) has the
same number of boundary components above gamma and gamma' (all page covers have
the same degree), and we're only allowed to glue them to each other, this
implies that there can be at most i(M,P,Sa) boundary components above gamma as
well. Since our choice of tildegamma was arbitrary, this implies that there are
at most C(M,P,Sa) = i(M,P,Sa)*j(M,P,Sa) many leftover boundary components.

% XXX I think we don't need this closed-arc condition anymore!

%Now, a simple trick: suppose tildeSa satisfies (dag) before we make a gluing.
%To violate (dag) after gluing, we have to either match up two endpoints of an
%arc to make a closed curve, or make an arc with two endpoints on the same
%boundary component. To do that, we have to match up endpoints of two arcs
%whose other (unglued) endpoints lie on the same boundary component of tildeSa.
%If we imagine a graph where the vertices are boundary components and edges are
%arc connections, this means we're gluing two vertices which are distance <=
%2 apart in the graph. This graph has at number of incident edges at each
%vertex bounded by n_a. So the number of vertices at distance <= 2 from C is
%bounded by na + na(na - 1) = na^2. This means that if tildeSa contains more
%than na2 many boundary components that match C (in that they'll glue to it
%along daM), we can glue C to one of the remaining ones, and our new glued
%surface will satisfy (dag). This contradicts our assumption that tildeSa
%didn't admit any more gluings.

%So tildeSa must contain at most na2 many boundary components that match C. But
%this argument works for any choice of C. Letting ja = sum k # components of
%Sa,k (this is the total number of boundary components downstairs we could
%choose downstairs for this argument), we find a bound
%
%# dtildeSa <= ja na^2

Proof of Theorem contd.

Now that we've constructed tildeS, we want to modify it so, in addition to
(dag), it satisfies

(ddag) Any two boundary components of tildeS lie on different pieces. That is,
they correspond to different connected components of tildeS(0) under the gluing
map tildeS(0) -> tildeS.

Intuitively, this should not be difficult. Before gluing, tildeS has at least
j(M,P,Sa)*n many boundary components, and afterwards at most
j(M,P,Sa)*i(M,P,Sa). If we choose n to be very large, we should be able to
modify the gluing so that the very few leftover boundary components are "far
apart" from each other.

Claim.

For n sufficiently large, by cutting and regluing we can rearrange tildeS so it
satisfies (dag) and (ddag). This requires a bounded number of cuts and gluings,
independent of the choice of n.

Proof of Claim.

To be precise, suppose tildeS has some piece with 2 or more boundary
components. We need to glue something to these boundary components, but by
construction tildeS doesn't admit any more gluings without violating (dag). To
get past this, we'll need to cut tildeS to find new places to glue. For each
piece, choose all but one of the leftover boundary components arbitrarily.
We're going to fix these boundary components by gluing.

Consider such a boundary component tildegamma. We want to cut somewhere that
won't interfere with any of the arcs with endpoints on tildegamma, and glue
there.  The problem is that while it's easy to count the possible places for
endpoints of arcs starting at tildegamma, it's unclear how many glued-up page
transitions those arcs might travel through along the way. If we cut in the
middle of an arc and glue up, we could still produce a closed loop
accidentally!

To avoid this, we proceed as follows. Let gamma' be the matching boundary
component downstairs, and consider all n*d components of pi-1(gamma'). Most of
these will be already glued to components of pi-1(gamma), but we still want to
consider them. Eliminate the components that lie on the same pieces, on either
side, as existing boundary components of tildeS (in particular, eliminate all
the components that are boundary components of tildeS).  Let sC be the set of
remaining components of pi-1(gamma').  Let sA be the set of arcs with endpoints
on tildegamma.

Now, if any member of sC is not crossed by an arc in sA, cut there and glue the
gamma' side to tildegamma. (dag) still holds: we can't introduce closed curves
by cutting, and our gluing could only produce a closed curve if we glued two
endpoints of an arc, which is impossible. (ddag) still holds by choice of sC.

Otherwise, look at the subset sA' cin sA of arcs that cross at least one member
of sC. For each arc alphai in sA', select the member tildegamma'i in sC that's
closest to its "origin" on tildegamma, and that isn't in the same piece (on
either side) as any other selected member of sC. If no such member of sC
exists, skip that arc.  Now cut all the chosen tildegamma'i. Let tildeS' be
this cut-up version of tildeS.

Finally, now that we've made these cuts, choose an arbitrary tildegamma' sC
that isn't in the same piece (on either side) as a boundary component of
tildeS'.  Note that such a member must always exist if we choose n sufficiently
large, because we have a fixed bound on the number of arcs in sA, and a bound
from above on the number of boundary components of tildeS.

We claim that we can cut and glue tildegamma' to tildegamma while maintaining
(dag).  Suppose not. Then there would have to be a closed loop created, coming
from some arc alpha at tildegamma. Before the cuts this arc crossed a member of
sC, so alpha in sA'. But since each arc in sA' was cut as close as possible to
the origin, there must be some tildegamma'i that intercepts alpha between
tildegamma and tildegamma'. Since we cut tildegamma'i already, this means that
tildegamma and tildegamma' cannot be joined by alpha. So (dag) is maintained.

We repeat this process for every tildeS boundary component beyond the first on
each piece. As shown above, the number of such boundary components is bounded
by i(M,P,Sa)*j(M,P,Sa). Each time, sA' contains at most i(M,P,Sa) arcs, so we
always have at most i(M,P,Sa)*j(M,P,Sa)*(2*i(M,P,Sa)+1) many boundary
components.  At any point in the cutting/gluing process, the number of elements
of pi-1(gamma') that overlap with pieces containing boundary components of
tildeS' is bounded by twice this number, so if we choose n large enough there
will always be additional components of pi-1(gamma') to choose from. So sC will
never be empty, and we'll always be able to choose members of sC satisfying the
different-piece condition.

This means that as we repeat this process, the number of boundary components of
tildeS' which violate (ddag) must be strictly decreasing - as during our
cutting, we always choose the new places to cut to lie on different pieces from
existing boundary components. So repeating this for every extra tildeS boundary
component we obtain tildeS' satisfying (dag) and (ddag). tildeS' has at most
i*j*(2i+1) many boundary components. At most i*(2i+1) of them lie above any
given boundary component downstairs.

%Now that we've made these cutsLook at the set of arcs traveling from C, and
%all the arcs from components directly adjacent to C in the arc graph (that is,
%connected to C by an arc).  There are at most na + na(na-1) = na^2 such arcs.
%If there is a place to glue that doesn't intersect any of the arcs, then we
%can glue immediately.

Proof of Theorem (conclusion).

Finally, suppose we've done the entire above construction for each boundary
component of our book of I-bundles M to produce a partially-glued surface with
some boundary components left over. We want to glue these together, but they
may have different numbers of boundary components over each page boundary where
we want to glue them! So we'll need to cut them all up even more.

Claim.

Let i = max a i(M,P,Sa). Let j = max a j(M,P,Sa). Then for n sufficiently
large, we can further cut tildeS' so that it has exactly i*(2i+1) many boundary
components above each boundary component downstairs.

Proof.

This is identical to the above argument, except that we don't need to worry
about the arcs because we aren't gluing. Since i is fixed (it depends only on
(M,P)), taking n large enough, there must always be many pieces above any gamma
that have no cuts.  Arbitrarily choose some to cut.

Finish Proof of Theorem.

Write tildeSa for the surface we obtain from the above construction for each
boundary component of M. Note that tildeSa is not quite a cover of the full
boundary component, because each one has these leftover boundary components
that we aren't allowed to glue.

Build a single surface tildeS by gluing the tildeSa as follows. For each spine
Mc of M, look at all the incident pages. Say there are m of them. Each page has
two sides, so there are 2m many pieces Sa,k downstairs near Mc, each with one
boundary component glued along the spine Mc. By the facts (0), (1), and (2) we
ensured above, we know that all these Sa,k are distinct and they are all glued
along simple parallel closed curves on dMc (do we know they're longitudes?  See
above).

By the work we did in the last claim, there are exactly i*(2i+1) many tildeSa
boundary components above each Sa,k boundary component. This means that at our
spine, all together we have 2m*i*(2i+1) incident leftover boundary components
of the tildeSa. Note that since we don't know the global behavior of the
boundary components of M, there may be anywhere from 1 to m boundary components
present in this local slice of the boundary components above Mc. But that
doesn't matter to our argument yet.

We know m>=3 by (0). Basically, we do our gluing by attaching everything
"anywhere except the way that boundary component goes." To be precise, if we
intersect a neighborhood of our spine Mc with dM, this intersection has
m components. Each component consists of a pi1-injective longitudinal annulus
in the spine's boundary connecting two neighborhoods that extend along
boundaries of two different pages attached to the spine. See diagram.

Our book of I-bundles is oriented by (2). To simplify the proof, we glue
following orientations of the tildeS induced by orientation of M. All the
boundary neighborhood annuli have a consistent orientation as they're parallel
on the boundary of a solid torus. So of the 2m Sa,k boundary components under
consideration, we can separate them into the + and - components. There are m of
each.

Notice that in our spine neighborhood, each page itself has 2 boundary
components, one of which is + and one is - (as above). Intuitively, each page
has one annulus "starting at it" and one annulus "ending at it". Furthermore,
as above each component of dM contains one + and one - component.

There are m + components and m - components. Assign a gluing downstairs by
attaching each + boundary component of an Sa,k to an arbitrary - component that
is neither of the 2 associated components in the above paragraph (the "same
page" component and the "same boundary" component). Since m>=3, we can do this
assignment consistently for all 2m of the local Sa,k boundary component. (For
instance, fix a cyclic order of the pages st the boundary components increase
by 1, and glue increasing by 2 instead).

Of course, this gluing is nonsensical downstairs, because the Sa,k are already
attached in other ways. However, this new "bent" gluing is the template we
follow upstairs. For each spine Mc, we have exactly 2m*i*(2i+1) incident
leftover boundary components of the tildeSa, and each of the 2m boundary
components described earlier has i*(2i+1) leftover boundary components above
it. So glue these following the +/- pattern we just chose. This yields
a surface tildeS.

By construction, tildeS consists of covers of each page of M glued along
parallel longitudinal annuli at the spines of M. By the covering lemma, it
induces an immersed pi1-injective surface. It remains to show that tildeS
cannot contain any lifts of parabolic curves.

Let gamma be a parabolic curve in some boundary component Sa of M. Cut gamma
into arcs gammai along the page boundaries. By construction of tildeSa, lifting
the gammai to tildeSa before the final gluing step cannot yield closed curves.
It only yields a union of arcs, by (dag). Now look at lifts of these arcs of
gamma to a different partial cover tildeSb, associated to a different boundary
component Sb of M. Certainly some gammai may lift to pieces of tildeSb,
anywhere that Sa and Sb traverse opposite sides of a page. Calling the Sb side
of that page Sb,k, we can see that gammai in barPb,k the "opposite parabolic
arcs" that we defined earlier. So gammai lifts to S'b,k as a union of arcs,
each of which connects two different boundary components of S'b,k. So it lifts
to tildeSb,k as a union of arcs the same way.

Now there is a simple reason that these arcs cannot possibly form closed curves
in tildeSb: Sa and Sb are not parallel for long enough. Look at such a gammai
that lifts to a union of arcs in tildeSb,k.  That is, gammai in barPb,k, and Sa
and Sb traverse opposite sides of this page Mj. Any spine that Mj attaches to
has at least 3 pages attached. If we look at how the boundary components of
a book of I-bundles behave near a spine, we that locally the Sa boundary
component will continue along a page, and the Sb boundary component will
continue along a different page. The page boundary facing the "continuation" of
Sb is not locally attached to Sa. (Note that it may very well be part of Sa,
but that would be due to global considerations of the gluing, farther away). So
the pieces of tildeSb that attach to the pieces with lifts of gammai can't
possibly contain lifts of a continuation of gammai, because that continuation
isn't in the correct "opposite parabolic arc" set. This proves that until our
last step, pieces of gamma only form arcs in tildeSa and the tildeSb. In fact,
not only are there no gammai closed curves in tildeSb, but the gammai cannot
form any arcs in tildeSb that traverse more than a single piece. This will be
important for the next step.

Finally, we need to look at what happens to these gammai lifts when we do the
last gluing step. Since the gammai only form arcs in each piece of tildeS, the
only way to form a closed curve is to join up two or more arcs in tildeSa
and/or the tildeSb.  But recall that by (ddag), each piece of each tildeSb has
at most one leftover boundary component. So any proper arc in tildeSb has to
traverse at least two pieces. This means that the gammai cannot lift and glue
to a proper arc in tildeSb, because they cannot traverse more than a single
piece, as shown above.

So any closed curve has to consist only of arcs in tildeSa, joined up when we
glued tildeSa to itself it the final step. This is possible, because by
cleverly gluing the same pages to many spines it's not hard to produce a book
of I-bundles with only one boundary component. But look at what has to happen
when we glue tildeSa to itself in the final step. In order to attach the gammai
to form a lift of gamma, looking near the endpoints of an arc in tildeSa, we
have to glue to a lift of a continuation of gamma downstairs. But by the same
argument as above (where Sa and Sb are not parallel), Sa cannot remain locally
parallel to itself "on the other side". Even if the continuation of gamma lifts
to the other side of our gluing, it would have to lift there because it's part
of the corresponding barPa,k, not Pa,k (because of how we chose the gluing
above, it can't be Pa,k because we didn't glue along the local boundary
component). This is all part of the same tildeSa, but now we're on the "wrong
part of it" for our parabolic gamma. Then by the same argument as for Sb gamma
cannot continue past the first piece traversal after a bent gluing. And it has
to traverse at least two pieces upstairs before bending back because of (ddag),
and can't return back to the same boundary component by definition of the
subgroup separability cover. In terms of tildeS, (ddag) tells us that each
piece has at most one bent gluing.

So we cannot join up the lifts of gammai to form a lift of gamma. This
completes the proof.


Theorem.

Let M be a book of I-bundles Kleinian manifold with incompressible boundary
satisfying (0), (1) and (2). Suppose M does contain a component of the
parabolic locus P inside a single page's boundary. Construct M' by deleting all
such pages from M, and P' by removing all components of the pared locus that
intersect those pages. Then (M,P) contains a surface satisfying (*) if and only
if (M',P') is nonempty and contains a surface satisfying (*).

Proof.

First observe that if (M,P) contains a surface satisfying (*), it cannot
traverse any of the pages we deleted to obtain M', by the same argument as in
our first example.  Since our surface exists, M' must be nonempty.
Furthermore, since (M',P') cin (M,P), it satisfies (*) for M',P' as well.
Conversely, if we have such a surface, we can obviously view it as contained in
(M,P), where it must satisfy (*) because it doesn't intersect the deleted pages
at all.

Note that (M',P') may be nonelementary, or it still may not satisfy (0), (1),
and (2).  However, we can repeat the steps needed to guarantee (0), (1), and
(2), and obtain a manifold where we can either apply this theorem again, or use
the first theorem. It is not immediately clear that this process terminates,
because taking the finite-sheeted cover we use for (1) and (2) makes the
manifold more complicated, possibly increasing the number of parabolics. We'll
have to do this carefully. Possibly we should do this step BEFORE the other
simplification, but then we'll have to make sure the parabolics pass through
that simplification nicely.

\section{Some generalizations - SCRUBBED}

The following section is obviated by the general case above. I'll keep it here
just in case we need something from it.

We use the following general notation for books of $I$-bundles. Let
$M_{c1},...,M_{cm}$ be the spines, all solid tori. Let $M_1,...,M_n$ be the
pages, all thickened surfaces. Each $M_i$ has boundary components
$A_{i1},...,A_{ik_i}$ all annuli. We glue each annulus to a boundary annulus on
some spine. For each spine, all these gluing annuli must be disjoint parallel
incompressible. If $M$ is nonelementary, We can assume without loss of
generality that all pages have negative Euler characteristic, and all spines
have at least 3 pages glued to them (otherwise, just consolidate into fewer
pages / spines).

Given such a book of $I$-bundles $M$, let $G=(V,E)$ be the graph associated to
the embedded surface $A = \bigcup_{i,j} A_{ij} \cin M$ which is the union of
all the page gluing annuli. Combinatorially, $G$ has a vertex for each spine or
page, and an edge for each gluing of a page to a spine along an annulus. We
call $G$ the gluing graph of the book of $I$-bundles.

We say a book of $I$-bundles is \emph{tree-shaped} if its gluing graph is
a tree.

As above, if the pared locus $P$ contains any components that fit inside
a single $I$-bundle, then we can ``cross off that page.'' Just like in our
earlier lemma, any $\pi_1$-injective surface that passed through that page
would have would have to contain the component of the pared locus. By
repeatedly crossing off pages and consolidating into fewer pages / spines, we
can reduce any pared book of $I$-bundles to one with no such components.

\begin{conj}

Let $M$ be a tree-shaped book of $I$-bundles. Suppose $P$ has no components
$P_0\cin \bd_\pm M_i$ for any $i$. Then there exists a surface satisfying
\eqref{E:qf}.

\end{conj}

We're quite certain that this is true. It should just be a hairy inductive
adaptation of the above argument. In particular, it is totally unclear how one
might construct a counterexample. However, we haven't completed a full proof
yet.

\begin{thm}

Let $M$ be a tree-shaped book of $I$-bundles. Suppose $P$ has no components
$P_0 \cin \bd_\pm M_i$ for any $i$. Suppose further that every
component of $P$ crosses at least one gluing circle at a spine where at least
4 pages are attached. Then there exists a surface satisfying \eqref{E:qf}.

In particular, note that if all spines are at least valence 4, the technical
crossing condition must be satisfied.

\end{thm}
\begin{proof}

Our construction of $S$ is very simple. In fact, in this case, $S$ embeds in
our book of $I$-bundles. Construct $S$ by starting with a single page's core
surface, and traversing the tree-shaped gluing as follows. For each boundary
component of $S$, look at the valence of the associated spine. If it's valence
3, choose an arbitrary one of the other two pages. If it's valence at least 4,
choose a page that's non-boundary-adjacent to $S$, in that neither boundary
component of the incoming page attaches to a boundary component of the newly
chosen page when we glue the book of $I$-bundles. This is always possible for
valence at least 4, because at a spine, each incoming boundary component
connects to a single outgoing boundary component, and there are only 2 incoming
boundary components but at least 3 new pages to choose from. Attach the core
surface of the chosen page to $S$ with an annulus across the core. Since $M$ is
tree-shaped, we can build $S$ inductively without it running into itself.

We claim $S$ satisfies \eqref{E:qf}. $S$ is immediately properly immersed (in
fact, embedded) and $\pi_1$-injective, as it's a union of page cores and spine
annuli. It suffices to check the pared locus. Suppose some $P_k$ had $\pi_1S
\cap \pi_1P_k neq 1$, ie some multiple of its core curve was homotopic into
$S$. By the crossing condition, $P_k$ must traverse a gluing circle on a spine
of valence at least 4.  But at such a spine, $P_k$, which is contained in
a boundary component of $M$, must connect two boundary-adjacent pages. But we
chose $S$ so it would connect at such a spine to a non-boundary-adjacent page.
Since $M$ is tree-shaped, applying van Kampen shows that these pages correspond
to different pieces of the amalgamated free product for $\pi_1M$, so it's
impossble for this curve to be in $\pi_1S$. This completes the proof.

\end{proof}

Finally, we have one more technical intermediate result. We hoped this would
extend to more cases, but we haven't been able to do anything with it yet.

Let $M$ be a book of $I$-bundles. Associated to every surface we construct in
an analogous way to what we've been doing (taking covers of the page core
surfaces and gluing them together), there's a set of fairly complicated graphs
we can construct as follows. For each $(M_i,A_{ij},\widetilde{S_i})$, where
$M_i$ is a page, $A_{ij}$ gluing annulus of that page, and $\widetilde{S_i}$
finite-sheeted cover of the page core surface, we can draw a \emph{local
pared-arc graph} $G=G(M_i,A_{ij},\widetilde{S_i})$.

The vertices are boundary components of $\widetilde{S_i}$ which sit above
$A_{ij}$. Two vertices are connected by an edge if there is an arc in the pared
locus which lifts to connect those two boundary components. For instance,
a double cover of the punctured torus page, with 3 disjoint non-parallel arcs
on each boundary, has a graph, over the single boundary annulus downstairs,
with 2 vertices and 3 edges (one between the two vertices, and one loop at each
vertex). This graph is a generalization of the cis-trans terminology we used in
that example.

We say a cover $\widetilde{S_i}$ is \emph{pared-bipartite} if each of its local
pared-arc graphs is bipartite. Note that none of the covers we constructed in
our first example are pared-bipartite. This is a very specialized condition.
Note also that if the pared locus does not intersect a page, all covers of that
page are pared-bipartite.

\begin{thm}

Let $M$ be a tree-shaped book of $I$-bundles. Suppose that $P$ has no
components in $\bd_\pm M_i$ for any $i$. Suppose that every page of $M$
has a pared-bipartite cover of its core surface. Then $M$ contains a surface
satisfying \eqref{E:qf}.

\end{thm}
\begin{proof}

First observe that every cover of a pared-bipartite cover is itself
pared-bipartite. Simply lift the partition of the vertices to obtain a new
partition of each local pared-arc graph. The arcs cannot break this
partition because otherwise they wouldn't cover arcs in the downstairs cover.

Choose a sufficiently large cover of a pared-bipartite cover of each page such
that at each spine, the number of incoming cover boundary components above each
incident page equal for that spine. We can do this taking a ``least common
multiple cover,'' unless pages are glued to the same spine multiple times. In
that case, choose a finite-sheeted cover of the book of $I$-bundles itself that
doesn't have this issue, lift the pared locus, and construct a surface there.
Afterwards, we can push it down and it will still satisfy \eqref{E:qf}.

% XXX careful! finite subgp separability covers of tree-shaped things aren't
% necessarily tree-shaped! might need another condition / argument here.

Now, we construct $S$ by gluing these large covers. For each $\widetilde{S_i}$
and downstairs gluing annulus $A_{ij}$ there will be two adjacent annuli in the
associated spine. For each $\widetilde{S_i}$, attach half the boundary
components above $A_{ij}$ to the boundary components coming from each of the
``neighboring'' $\widetilde{S_i}$, via annuli. Use the pared-bipartite
structure to split the set of boundary components above $A_{ij}$ in half. Since
the number of incoming boundary components match at each spine, as constructed
above, the boundary components will match up. We have a ``cover boundary
component bipartition'' above each $A_{ij}$. Note that once we have the
bipartition, the details of how we glue the pieces inside the bipartition are
irrelevant.

We claim the resulting $S$ satisfies \eqref{E:qf}. We already know it's proper
immersed $\pi_1$-injective by the same arguments. To show it doesn't overlap
with the pared locus, observe that by the definition of local pared-arc graphs,
every core curve in the pared structure must correspond to a sequence of arcs
in covers, where each arc either connects boundary components above different
annuli $A_{ij}$, $A_{ij'}$, or it connects 2 boundary components above the same
annulus $A_{ij}$. But it cannot connect two boundary components above the same
annulus, as we glued those according to the pared bipartition in such a way
that the pared arc component, which is locally restricted to a single boundary
component of the $I$-bundles, can't follow. This is a generalization of the
first argument in our simplest case.

Note that if the arc connects boundary components above different annuli, these
annuli must attach to different spines (by our earlier simplifying assumption).
But now because $M$ is tree-shaped, no arc that's been redirected toward
different spines can possibly form a closed loop. This completes the proof.

\end{proof}

We tried to do this proof in the non-tree-shaped case, but it doesn't work!
There are counterexamples of pared-bipartite covers where the obvious fix
relies on messy combinatorics inside the boundary component matching.

\section{Next steps - SCRUBBED}

% XXX talk a bit about my ideas for cis/trans and gen bipartition
It should be possible to prove the case of general tree-shaped books of
$I$-bundles. In fact, combinatorially, it seems that all books of $I$-bundles
(satisfying an appropriate condition on components of $P$) should admit these
surfaces. But we haven't proved anything yet. The general case is much messier
(combinatorially) than the tree-shaped case, because in addition to cis arcs
we'll also need to consider trans arcs that ``wrap around'' a loop in the
gluing graph. So even ensuring that every closed curve in the pared structure
is broken into arcs, at least one of which is trans, is insufficient.

We chose to study books of $I$-bundles first. Ian thinks the other infinite
volume cases ought to be easier. What about acylindrical manifolds?  Books of
$I$-bundles are somehow the opposite end of the spectrum of acylindrical
- they're glued together along a bunch of cylinders, and the pieces are all
very simple ($I$-bundles).  If we can address the acylindrical and book of
$I$-bundle cases we ought to be able to put these together to solve the entire
problem. Ian thinks maybe the acylindrical case can be addressed by a variant
of the Baker-Cooper argument.
