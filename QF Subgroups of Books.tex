\begin{abstract} Given a Kleinian group $G$, one can ask whether the group
contains any quasifuchsian surface subgroups. Equivalently, given a pared
hyperbolic 3-manifold $(M,P)$, one can ask whether there exists a closed
immersed surface in $M$ that avoids the peripheral subgroups associated to $P$.
This question is already known for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds
(Kahn-Markovic), and for finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds (Masters-Zhang).
We derive explicit results for pared 3-manifolds $(M,P)$ where $M$ is a book of
I-bundles. \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Let $M$ be a hyperbolic 3-manifold. $M$ has many possible realizations as
a Kleinian group $G$ quotient manifold. By work of Jorgensen (Characteristic
Submanifold theory?) the study of hyperbolic structures on a 3-manifold can be
reduced to studying pared 3-manifold structures on the boundary. The pared
structure gives data specifying the loci on the boundary corresponding to the
cusps of the Kleinian group / hyperbolic manifold.

To ask whether the Kleinian group contains a quasifuchsian subgroup in this
case boils down to asking whether we can find a closed immersed
$\pi_1$-injective surface which avoids these parabolics up to homotopy. That
is, we're trying to choose a surface subgroup of $G=\pi_1(M)$ which does not
contain any of the peripherial elements in the image of the embedding $P\to M$,
where $(M,P)$ is the pared 3-manifold structure with $P$ the parabolic locus.
Or any multiples of those elements.

There is some existing work related to this. Cooper, Long, and Reid addressed
the underlying topological problem, showing that a compact connected
irreducible 3-manifold with non-empty incompressible boundary  must contain an
essential closed surface, unless it's covered by a product $F\times I$.
However, this surface may contain accidental parabolics, and fail to be
quasifuchsian.  In the closed hyperbolic case, Kahn and Markovic proved that
there always exists an immersed closed hyperbolic $\pi_1$-injective surface in
any closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. Such a surface is necessarily quasifuchsian
because the hyperbolic 3-manifold is closed, hence contains no parabolics.
Finally, Baker and Cooper (re-proving work of Masters and Zhang) showed that
every finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold with cusps contains a quasifuchsian
subgroup.

The remaining case is infinite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. So far we've only
addressed a particular example of this case.

%Let M be a hyperbolic 3-manifold which is a book of I-bundles. That is, it is
%constructed as follows. Begin with a set of disjoint copies of S1 - these are
%the spines. Attach compact surfaces with boundary, the pages, to these spines
%with attaching maps (which can map one of more times around, in either
%direction). However, we insist that the attaching map wrap the same number of
%times in the same direction for each spine (ie, if we look at just one spine,
%all the pages are "parallel"). Then thicken the resulting 2-complex, to obtain
%a 3-manifold. If a surface wraps more han once around a spine, we will further
%have to make a choice of the transverse "spiralling" direction which we use to
%make sure the attaching maps is a hmeomorphism onto its image. The thickened
%surface boundary component (a copy of S1xI) maps to the boundary of the
%thickened spine (S1xS1).  Noete that we also use "spine" and "page" to refer to
%the thickened boundary components. We call the result a book of I-bundles by
%analogy with building a book by gluing pages to a spine parallel along one side
%- here, we glue thickened surfaces, or I-bundles, to a spine in order parallel
%along one boundary component.
%
%Almost all books of I-bundles are hyperbolic (why?). For now, let's just say
%it's because almost all 3-manifolds are hyperbolic. As discussed above, given
%a Kleinian group realization (representation?) of a given book of I-bxundlem M,
%we can exhibit a quasifuchsian subgroup recisely when we can produce
%a pi1-injective immersed closed surface which pi1-avoids the pared locus
%associated to the Kleinian group structure on M - this is a locus representing
%the curves that descend down to the parabolic fixed points? See Morgan-Bass and
%Canary-McCullough for details on the basics of pared 3-manifolds.
%
%At the very least, let's define pared 3-manifolds. A pared 3-manifold is ...
%something (TODO)
%
%Ian Agol has provided a lemma which we'll use repeatedly to construct these
%pi1-injective immersed surfaces, or prove that it's impossible.
%
%Agol Lemma: Let f:S1->S2 be a pi1-injective immersion between two surfaces.
%Then f is (homotopic to) a covering map.
%
%Proof: (TODO - look in old notes and write it down!)
%
%The basic idea is as follows. A pi1-injective immersed surface in
%M corresponds, after cutting the book of I-bundles back up along the gluing
%annuli into spines and pages, to a set of pi1-injective surfaces in each page
%(an I-bundle), along with an attachment between these pages along each spine.
%In order to be pi1-injective, the attachment between pages at the spine must be
%simple - the spine has just a simple homotopy group S1, and so the page
%attachments cannot be along a complicated surface embedded in the spine, but
%must just be the obvious union of annuli. So a quasifuchsian candidate surface
%inside a book of I-bundles can be represented by a union of immersed
%pi1-injective surfaces, one in each page, together with identifications among
%the boundary components of these surface pieces that line up with a given
%spine.
%
%But now, because each surface piece is a pi1-injective immersion into an
%I-bundle, we can contract the I-bundle (by orientability, all the I-bundles are
%actually trivial - at least in the cases I want to consider for now - if not,
%can probably use covering space trickery to fix it) to a surafec. Applying the
%lemma, we see that every surface piece is homotopic to a covering surface of
%that page (viewed as a surface, before thickening).
%
%Now let's look at the pared 3-manifold condition we need to check to make sure
%our resulting surface is quasifuchsian. Our parabolic locus will consist of
%a set of disjoint embedded annuli and tori in the boundary of our book of
%I-bundles. Now, none of these components can be tori, because the boundary
%components of a book of I-bundles ll have genus at least two, by construction
%(in order to produce a boundary component of smaller genus, since boundary
%components "follow through" cores along adjacent pages, we'd have to have at
%least one page of genus zero - and we can just pass through a homotopy that
%eliminates them (or a homeomorphism? Mostow rigidity etc. It's easier to see
%the homotopy though I think). That argument seems like mild BS, but anyway
%we're only considering books of I-bundles where all the bundles have genus >=
%1, and of course at least one boundary component. So there cannot be any pared
%tori, ie rank 2 cusps, in a book of I-bundles.
%
%For the rank 1 cusps, or pared annuli, each annulus traces out a core curve on
%the boundary component. If we're looking in pi1, it suffices to avoid these
%curves. If we can construct a quasifuchsian candidate surface that avoids these
%parabolic locus curves, it'll be quasifuchsian, as desired. And any
%quasifuchsian surface must descend to a cover on each page, and those covers
%must glue together across the spines, so if we can show that there is NO choice
%of covers that glues and avoids the parabolics, then that book of I-bundles
%cannot contain a quasifuchsian surface.
%
%So, to summarize, the problem of finding a quasifuchsian surface subgroup of
%a book of I-bundles M is equivalent to the following problem: given a set of
%disjoint non-parallel simple closed curves on each component of dM, find
%a cover of each core surface Ei of the pages Mi and an identification of the
%boundary components dEij of these surfaces that meet at each spine Nj, such
%that the resulting glued surface doesn't contain any of the elements of pi1M
%corresponding to the given parabolic locus curves.
%
%Finally, to ensure the surface doesn't contain the parabolic locus curves,
%since the surface is locally a cover on each I-bundle and the immersion is
%homotopic to a covering of the core, any homotopy of a parabolic locus curve
%into the quasifuchsian candidate surface would correspond on each I-bundle to
%a homotopy (rel cut boundary) of the corresponding arcs into arcs on the
%covering surface, ie lifts of these arcs rel boundary viewed as retracted arcs
%on the core surface of this I-bundle. So to prove this cover does not contain
%pi1M elements corresponding to parabolic locus curves, it suffices to show that
%there do not exist lifts of the arc components in each I-bundle of the locus
%curves that connect up to form closed curves, when connected across the mouth
%gluings of the quasifuchsian surface.
%
%A picture of this (or many pictures!) would be really helpful.
%
%We believe that the following conjecture holds, but we haven't proven it in all
%cases yet.
%
%Conjecture: Let M be a book of I-bundles, and P any pared locus. Then (M,P)
%contains a quasifuchsian surface subgroup.
%
%Careful! This definitely isn't right. For instance, if the pared locus consists
%entirely of curves that stay inside a single I-bundle, one for each I-bundle,
%then we're totally stuck. Otherwise, we need to "cross that one off". What's
%that mean? I think we can get away with remove that page from the book of
%I-bundles, along with all parabolics that pass through it. If it's still
%possible to construct a surface on what's remaining, that one will work.
%
%We'll go through what we've proven so far, case by case.

% XXX figure out if I need the Fathi-Laudenbach-Poenaru stuff or not. Right now
% it looks like I don't, at least for the cases I've done so far. But it might
% come in handy later for more complicated pages? Not sure.

%\section{Background details}
%
%These are some background facts that we'll need to go through the examples in
%detail.
%
%Arcs in surfaces with boundary - from Fathi-Laudenback-Poenaru, Exposes 2 and
%4 (see p. 21-24, 43-52).
%This is an exposition of coordinates for classes of arcs in a surface
%with boundary, aka Dehn-Thurston coordinates.
%
%Let A(N) be the set of isotopy classe sof simple closed proper arcs I\in N such
%that they represent nontrivial elements of pi1 rel boundary. We isotope them
%with the ends of the arcs free to move within the boundary components they are
%contained in. Similarly A'(N) with simple closed multi-arcs, up to isotopy.
%
%Theorem (FLP 2.11). Let P2 be the standard pair of pants. A(P2) consists of
%exactly six elements, classified by the boundary components of their endpoints.
%
%Theorem (FLP 2.12). A'(P2) is isomorphic to
%A'={(a1,a2,a3) in Z | sum ai is even }
%via the map
%i:A'(P2)->A'
%i(tau) = (i(tau, d1),i(tau,d2),i(tau,d3)) where d1,d2,d3 are the boundary
%components of P2, and i(,) is geometric intersection number.
%
%That is, simple closed multicurves exist and are uniquely determined, for each
%choice of boundary intersection numbers of the correct parity.
%
%Finally, given a closed surface, let N, let S(N) be the set of isotopy classes
%of simple closed curves on N, and S'(N) simple closed multicurves.
%
%Theorem (FLP 4.8). Let N be a closed surface of negative Euler characteristic.
%Fix a pants decomposition of N into 2g-2 pairs of pants along 3g-3 disjoint
%simple closed curves K1,...,K3g-3. Then
%
%S'(N) is isomorphic to B0 = {(mi,si,ti) in Z, i = 1,...,3g-3 | all coords >= 0,
%and for each pair of pants the corresponding mi sum is even}
%where the mi measure intersection numbers with the curves K1,...,K3g-3, and the
%si,ti measure twisting around at each intersection curve as a rational number.
%See FLP for details of the calculation of the twisting coordinates - we won't
%be needing it here (at least, not yet!).
%
%We actually require a slight generalization of this result, but the proof is
%identical.
%
%Theorem. Let SA'(N) be the set of disjoint multi-curves or arcs on N, a surface
%possibly with boundary. That is, each element of SA'(N) corresponds to a union
%of simple closed curves and simple arcs on N, all disjoint, such that the arcs
%are properly embedded, up to isotopy where the arcs are permitted to slide on
%each boundary component. Then SA'(N) is isomorphic to the obvious choice, where
%we again decompose into pairs of pants, have mi for each boundary curve or
%decomposition curve, but si,ti only for each decomposition curve.
%
%Finally, let A''(N) (or maybe some better notation, etc) be the set of simple
%proper multi-arcs satisfying the condition that no two components of the
%multi-arc are parallel, ie, isotopic. Alternatively we can think of A''(N) as
%consisting of simplices in the arc complex of N, or as a quotient of A'(N)
%where we identify multicurves along splitting / joining of parallel arcs. In
%general, A''(N) is more difficult to parametrize, as purely from the
%coordinates it is difficult to determine which multicurves or multiarcs will
%contain parallel components.
%
%We define S''(N), SA''(N) similarly.
%
%Example. Consider the pair of pants P2. We know A(P2) has 6 elements, so
%A''(P2) has at most 2**6 elements, corresponding to which arcs are present in
%our multi-arc. It suffices to check that all 6 arcs can be
%embedded in P2 without intersecting.
%
%Example. Consider the punctured torus S1,1. We first compute SA'(S1,1). By the
%generalized Dehn-Thurston coordinates theorem above, (work this out on paper
%first)

\section{More background - pared manifolds and stuff}

Definition and important facts about pared manifolds. After Morgan, The Smith
Conjecture, V ("Uniformization Theorem for Three-Dimensional Manifolds"),
p 58-60. Or Canary-McCullough, Homotopy Equivalences of 3-Manifolds and
Deformation Theory of Kleinian Groups, Ch 5 p. 87-92. Also Ch 7 p.105-107. Note
that Canary-McCullough is much more recent.

(Morgan p58) (Canary-McCullough p87)
Def. A pared manifold $(M,P)$ is a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold
$M$,
together with $P$ in $dM$, such that the following conditions hold:

(1) Every component of P is a torus or annulus, incompressible in M.
(2) Every noncyclic abelian subgroup of pi1M is peripheral with respect to P,
ie, conjugate to the pi1 of a component of P.
(3) (M,P) is "annulus-incompressible": every pi1-injective map (A2, dA2) ->
(M,P) is homotopic (as a map of pairs) to a map into P.

We call P the pared locus or parabolic locus of the pared manifold (M,P).

Note that there are a few pared manifolds that are sometimes special cases,
like with elementary Kleinian groups. (In fact, these are precisely the pared
manifolds that correspond to elementary Kleinian groups under the construction
below).

Def. A pared manifold (M,P) is elementary if it is one of the following:
(T2xI,T2x0), (A2xI,A2x0), (A2xI,empty), (or (Morgan only) (S3, empty)).

(Morgan p59, Canary-McCullough p88)
Prop. Let (M,P) nonelementary. Every component of dM-P has negative Euler
characteristic. In fact, Canary-McCullough makes some stronger statements:
(i) M is not a T2xI, K2 I-bundle, or A2xI (solid torus).
(ii) M does not contain an embedded K2
(iii) For every component Q of P, pi1Q is a maximal abelian subgroup of pi1M.

Pared manifolds arise naturally in the study of Kleinian groups. Given
a geometrically finite torsion-free Kleinian group G, we construct (M,P) by
truncating small neighborhoods of the cusps of the quotient manifold MG
= H3uO(G)/G.  Then we let M be the resulting compact manifold with boundary,
and P the boundary locus along which we truncated. That is, we can rebuild the
quotient manifold from (M,P) by gluing cusp neighborhoods onto each component
of P. It follows from basic Kleinian group theory that the resulting (M,P) will
satisfy conditions 1-3 above, making it a pared manifold. The parabolic
elements of G precisely correspond to (conjugacy classes of) the peripheral
subgroups piP in pi1M.

Conversely, Thurston's famous uniformization theorem states that for every
pared manifold (M,P) with M Haken, there exists a finite volume (in particular,
geometrically finite) hyperbolic 3-manifold structure on the interior
satisfying the appropriate conditions for a pared 3-manifold! (see Morgan for
details of this construction)

To be precise:

(Morgan p60, but his statement is confusing / less modern definitions. He does
state the more general theorem for Haken pared manifolds though.)
(Canary-McCullough p105-106)
Theorem. If (M,P) is an oriented pared 3-manifold with nonempty boundary, then
there exists a geometrically finite uniformization of (M,P), that is, a map
rho: pi1M -> PSL2C such that rho(g) is parabolic if g in pi1(P), and an
orientation-preserving homeomorphism M-P -> (H3
u Omega(rho(pi1M)))/(rho(pi1M)).

See discussion on (CMc p106, bottom of page) for why this definition of
geometrically finite is equivalent to the standard one.

Example. Maybe?

\section{Our reduction}

In our result, we study the problem of finding quasifuchsian surface subgroups
of Kleinian groups from the topological perspective. We convert our given
Kleinian group to a pared 3-manifold, and look for surface subgroups of this
Kleinian group that avoid the peripheral pared structure.

Theorem / Statement of plan. Finding a quasifuchsian surface subgroup of
a Kleinian group is reduced by the following theorem:

Theorem (Baker-Cooper Theorem 1.7 - "work of Bonahon and Thurston"). Let M be
a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with finite volume, and S a closed oriented
pi1-injective immersed surface of negative Euler characteristic. Then either
S is a virtual fiber, or S is geometrically finite. In the second case, it's
either quasiFuchsian or some element of pi1S is parabolic.

We assume this reduction still works in our cases (which are not finite
volume). I hope some reference to Thurston can fix this.

So in our case, since the parabolic elements precisely correspond to the pared
structure, our problem becomes a purely topological one: can we find a
closed immersed pi1-injective surface of negative Euler characteristic, that
doesn't contain any of the pared locus, up to homotopy?

Since we're working in the case of books of I-bundles, we can reduce the pared
locus by observing that there are no torus boundary components of M, so all the
components of the pared locus must be annuli (as they're pi1-injective). For
each annulus, since we're only concerned with its homotopy class, it suffices
to consider the core curve.

\section{Our first example - take 2}

We construct a book of I-bundles M as follows. In the following we take S1,1 to
be the compact surface of genus 1 with a single boundary component, a circle.
Abusing terminology slightly, we'll call this the punctured torus.
Let M1,M2,M3 be 3 punctured
torus I-bundles. M1,M2,M3=S1,1xI. or each Mi, write dMi = dS1,1xI u S1,1x0
u S1,1 x 1. We write these boundary pieces as dMi = Ai u d-Mi u d+Mi. Let Mc
= S1xD2 be a solid torus. Attach the Mi to Mc by gluing the Ai to parallel
annuli in dMc, each with longitudinal core curve. The result is a compact
3-manifold with boundary M. We choose orientations and a cyclic order for the
gluing such that the 3 boundary components of M are precisely
dM=d12M u d23M u d31M = (d+M1 uS1 d-M2) u (d+M2 uS1 d-M3) u (d+M3 uS1 d-M1).
Each boundary component of M consists of two punctured tori glued along their
boundary circles, topologically a genus two surface.

We consider possible pared structures P on M. Our goal is to find a closed
immersed pi1-injective surface S in M such that pi1Pk intersect pi1S = empty
for each component Pk of P. We'll call this condition (*).

Note that since we
haven't fixed a basepoint, these subgroups are really only defined up to
conjugacy - what we're saying is they fail to intersect for an arbitrary choice
of conjugacy class for each subgroup. (ask Ian about this? seems fuzzy)

Lemma. ("Ian's covering lemma") Let S be a surface satisfying (*). Homotope
S to have minimal intersection with each Ai, that is, so there are no "bumps".
Then for each Mi, each component of S intersect Mi is a finite-sheeted covering
of the core surface. That is, given such a component S' in Mi, the map S' -> Mi
= S1,1xI -> S1,1x{1/2} is homotopic to a finite-sheeted covering
map. Conversely, given any finite-sheeted covering Stilde -> S1,1, there
exists a corresponding proper immersed pi1-injective surface S in S1,1xI.

Proof. S is compact, so every such component S' is a compact surface with
boundary, properly immersed in Mi. Since S is pi1-injective in M, S' must be
pi1-injective in Mi. Otherwise, we'd have a nontrivial element of pi1S' which
is trivial in pi1Mi, hence in pi1M, hence in pi1S, contradicting the minimal
position homotopy above. So the map phi : S'->S1,1x{1,2} is also pi1-injective,
since Mi deformation retracts to its core. Let H = phi*(pi1S'), and let S1,1H
be the cover of S1,1 associated to H<pi1S1,1. phi lifts to phitilde : S' ->
S1,1H. This is a proper map of compact surfaces which is an isomorphism on pi1.
By the classification of surfaces, it must be homotopic (as a proper map) to
a homeomorphism. So phi is homotopic to a covering map. It must be
finite-sheeted as S' is compact (by classification of surfaces again).

Conversely, given a finite-sheeted cover Stilde -> S1,1, compose with the
embedding S1,1 = S1,1x{1/2} in S1,1xI. This is proper and pi1-injective.
Perturb locally to obtain an immersion.

Lemma. Let P be a pared structure on M. P cannot contain any tori. That is,
P consists entirely of annuli.

Proof. We can compute pi1M directly from the van Kampen theorem. Let ai,bi be
the generators of pi1(Mi), and c be the generator of pi1(Mc). Our gluing yields
pi1(M) = <a1,b1,a2,b2,a3,b3,c| [a1,b1]=[a2,b2]=[a3,b3]=c>. It immediately
follows that pi1M contains no rank 2 abelian subgroups, as no two elements
commute. Since every component of P is pi1-injective, they must all be annuli.

Proposition. Suppose P contains a component P0 that, up to homotopy, is
contained entirely within one "I-bundle half" of a boundary component. That is,
P0 in dMi, for some i. Without loss of generality we can let P0 in dM1. Then
there exists a surface satisfying (*) if and only if P contains no components
that are (up to homotopy) contained in dM2 u dM3 = d-M2 u d23M u d+M3.

Proof. (<=) Take S=d23M. Intuitively, it's easy to see that the conditions on
P force all its components to lie on surfaces where they can't be homotoped
into S.

Algebraically, pi1S is the subgroup generated by
a2,b2,a3,b3 in pi1M. pi1S = <a2,b2,a3,b3 | [a2,b3]=[a3,b3]>. P contains no
components in d23M, so an arbitrary component Pk of P  must be contained in
d12M or d31M, which have fundamental groups generated by (a1,b1,a2,b2) and
(a3,b3,a1,b1) respectively. pi1Pk is cyclic, so let g be its generator. No
matter if it's contained in d12M or d31M, we can see that in order for pi1Pk to
overlap with pi1S, it must have generator some word in a2,b2 (if Pk in d12M),
or some word in a3,b3 (if Pk in d31M). In either case, this is precisely the
condition for such a word to correspond to a curve contained in dM2 or dM3,
respectively, contradicting our assumption on P.

(=>) Let S be a surface satisfying (*). Cut S into components in M1,M2,M3
(after homotoping to minimal intersections with the annuli). Applying Ian's
covering lemma, we can see that S intersect M1 = empty, as otherwise since it's
a finite-sheeted cover it would have to contain a multiple of P0.
So S in M2 u M3 u Mc, which is homeomorphic to S2 x I. Deformation retracting
this to a surface S2 and applying a covering argument like in Ian's lemma, we
can see that S is a cover of S2. Since it's a finite-sheeted cover, it will
have to have pi1 intersecting any component Pk that violates the conditions
stated above. This completes the proof.

Theorem. Let P be a pared structure containing no components P0 as in the above
proposition. Then there exists a surface satisfying (*).

This is the main theorem we prove for this example. A few preliminary facts are
required. Note that we can first isotope P such that it's in minimal position
on each boundary component with respect to the gluing circle.

Lemma. Under the hypotheses of the theorem, each "I-bundle half" P intersect
d+Mi (or d-Mi) is a thickening of a set of disjoint essential arcs, each arc
connecting d(d+Mi) to itself. The arcs form at most 3 "bands", where all the
arcs in each band are parallel.  Furthermore, if we choose a representative arc
from each band (yielding a set of at most 3 disjoint non-parallel arcs in
S1,1), there exists an automorphism of S1,1 taking these arcs to a standard set
of 3 disjoint non-parallel arcs.  See diagram for an illustration of the
standard set.

Proof. We first need a preliminary definition. After cutting a surface with
boundary along arcs, we'll obtain one or more connected surfaces, each with one
or more boundary components. Each boundary component after cutting will have
pieces from the original boundary as well as pieces from the arcs that we cut
along. Given labels gamma1,...,gammak for the boundary components and
alpha1,...,alphal for the arcs (on the original surface with boundary), we can
describe each boundary component of the cut surfaces as a union of arcs, each
labeled with gamma1,...,gammak,alpha1,...,alphal. We call this an arc pattern
for that boundary.

We first show that S1,1 admitts at most 3 disjoint essential non-parallel arcs,
and the possible surfaces and arc patterns obtained by cutting along these arcs
are very restricted.

Label the boundary component of S1,1 by gamma. Consider a proper essential arc
alpha1 in S1,1. Fix an orientation for alpha1. Since S1,1 is orientable, we can
look at local neighborhoods of alpha1 and see that alpha1 has a well-defined
"left side" and "right side" as we travel along it. Looking at the endpoints of
alpha1 along gamma, we are forced to connect certain endpoints in the cut-up
gamma with alpha1, in order to preserve the parity. This tells us the (possibly
disconnected) cut surface S1 will have two boundary components. Each will have
an arc pattern consisting of two arcs, one labeled gamma and one labeled
alpha1.

Since we cut along a properly embedded arc, the Euler characteristic increases
by one. x(S1)=0 and S1 has two boundary components. By classification of
surfaces, S1 = S0,2 or S0,1 u S1,1. But if S1 contained a disk with the arc
pattern described above, embedding that disk back in S1,1 would describe
a homotopy of alpha1 into the boundary. So S1 = S0,2.

Now suppose we had a second proper essential arc alpha2 in S1,1, disjoint from
and non-parallel to alpha1. Since it's disjoint from alpha1, alpha2 induces
a proper arc in S1 which connects two regions in the arc pattern labeled gamma.
alpha2 must have one endpoint on each boundary component of S1. If both are on
the same side, it's either homotopic to the boundary of S1,1 or parallel to
alpha1. Cutting along alpha2 yields a new surface S2. Topologically S2=D2, with
arc pattern consisting of 8 components in the cyclic order
(gamma,alpha1,gamma,alpha2,gamma,alpha1,gamma,alpha2).

Finally, adding our 3rd proper essential arc alpha3, disjoint and non-parallel
to the first two arcs, a similar argument shows that alpha3 must connect
opposite gamma pieces in the arc pattern. Cutting along alpha3 yields two disks
with the same arc pattern. Depending on the choice of alpha3, the arc pattern
on these disks is either (gamma,alpha1,gamma,alpha2,gamma,alpha3) or
(gamma,alpha1,gamma,alpha3,gamma,alpha2). So up to relabeling
alpha1,alpha2,alpha3, cutting along 3 proper essential disjoint non-parallel
arcs has only one possible choice of cut surfaces and arc patterns.

Observe that it is not possible to add any more disjoint non-parallel arcs. In
particular, any arc we draw between gamma components of the arc pattern on
either disk is homotopic to the boundary or parallel to an existing arc.
Furthermore, if we add new disjoint arcs and allow them to be parallel, we can
see that they must form "bands" around the existing 3 arcs in order to remain
disjoint. That is, we can homotope all the arcs parallel to a given arc into
a small neighborhood of that arc in the disk, without intersecting any of the
non-parallel arcs.

We claim there exists an automorphism of S1,1 taking any set of 3 such arcs to
any other set (in particular, to the standard set, as illustrated). Since there
is only one topological result of cutting along the arcs, choose
a homeomorphism of the cut surfaces. Up to relabeling the arcs, we can choose
a homeomorphism that identifies matching arcs in the arc patterns (as shown
above, there is only one possible arc pattern up to relabeling). Glue both
sides along the arcs to obtain the desired automorphism of S1,1.

We now consider P intersect d+Mi in d+Mi = S1,1. As shown, P is a union of
annuli. By the assumptions of the theorem, no annulus of P is contained in
d+Mi, so each annulus intersects d+Mi in a union of rectangles, where two sides
of the rectangle are embedded in the boundary d(d+Mi). Since we homotoped P to
have minimal intersections, all the core arcs of the rectangles (pieces of the
core curve of the annulus) must be essential. They are disjoint by definition
of P. The statement of the lemma follows from applying the above argument to
these core arcs.

We consider a connected cover S1,1tilde -> S1,1 homeom d+Mi (or d-Mi) with two
boundary components. Every core arc (as in above lemma) of P intersect d+Mi
lifts to arcs in S1,1tilde. We say such an arc is cis for a given cover if
both endpoints of any (ie all) lifts of that arc lie in the same boundary
component upstairs. Otherwise, we say it's trans for that cover.

Lemma. Given any 3 disjoint non-parallel proper arcs in S1,1, and any double
cover of S1,1, 2 of the 3 arcs are trans, and the 3rd is cis.
Furthermore, we can choose any two of the three we wish to be trans with an
appropriate cover.

Proof. As in earlier lemma, there exists an automorphism of S1,1
taking these 3 arcs to the standard set of 3 disjoint non-parallel proper arcs.
Now it suffices to observe, by looking at relative first homology or just by
construction, that each of the three standard connected double covers
(corresponding to nonzero maps Z2 -> Z/2) makes two of the three arcs trans and
the third cis.

Proof of theorem.

Since P has no components P0, every P intersect d+Mi is a union of thickened
arcs (that is, there are no full annulus components in any d+Mi or d-Mi). Apply
the first lemma to break these into bands. The problem is most constrained when
there are 3 bands, so we'll consider that case (if there are fewer than 3, just
draw some more arcs on that component arbitrarily, and the proof still works).

We will build our surface S by taking a double cover of the core S1,1 surface
for each I-bundle page M1,M2,M3. Call these covers S1,S2,S3. Each of these has
two boundary components. We'll then attach the boundary components such that
each of S1,S2,S3 has exactly one boundary component connected to each of the
others.  See diagram.

Choose an arbitrary connected double cover for S1. We can view this as a cover
of d+M1 or d-M1, deformation retracting either way. By the lemma, two of the
3 bands on d+M1 are trans, and the other is cis. The same holds for d-M1.

We cannot choose S2 arbitrarily, as a cis arc for S1 in d+M1 may connect (in S)
to a cis arc for S2 in d-M2. These together would form a closed curve that
lifts to S, which once S is immersed in M will yield a violation of condition
(*). Instead, observe that there is at most one band of the three in d-M2
containing arcs that, when glued across the core circle, match up to arcs in
the cis band of d+M1 to form closed curves containing only arcs in those two
bands. This is because once one band has that behavior, by endpoint parity the
vertices can't also match up for a different band, if the arcs they have to
match with on the other side are parallel. Looking at the boundary circle,
non-parallel arcs have endpoints in cyclic order, but parallel arcs don't). See
diagram. It suffices to check this for our standard set of non-parallel arcs,
by the same automorphism argument.

Since there is only one such band on d-M2, choose S2 such that this band is not
cis.  Finally, for S3 we have two connecting constraints. We have a cis band on
d-M1 from our choice of S1, and a cis band on d+M2 from our choice of S2.
Applying the same argument, there is at most one band on d-M3 and one band on
d+M3 that will connect to form closed curves. But we can choose S3 such that
both of these bands are trans. (This requires a slight modification to the
lemma - since these bands are on different boundary surfaces, they may not be
disjoint non-parallel. If they aren't disjoint, we can tweak them by local
modifications so they are, and then "untweak" them in the cover. If they are
parallel, just ignore one set of bands)

Glue S1,S2,S3 as described to obtain S. We claim that S satisfies condition
(*). S is closed and immersed by construction (as in Ian's covering lemma). It
is pi1-injective inside each I-bundle by Ian's covering lemma, and inside the
core Mc because it's just a union of incompressible gluing annuli there. It
suffices to show that pi1S intersect pi1Pk = 1 for each component Pk of the
pared locus. Looking at the core curve of the annulus Pk, this implies that
some multiple of that core curve is homotopic into S.

But this is impossibly by the above construction. Every such curve contains at
least two bands, on two different components d+-Mi. By the construction of S,
of any two bands which connect up when the boundary components are glued across
circles, at least one must be trans. This means that when we try to homotope
the core curve multiple into S, in order to follow along S locally (in each
page, where S is locally a cover of the core surface, it must be a lift from
that core surface) it would have to traverse between all three pieces of the
cover, as that's how we connected up the Si. Every trans arc lifts to an arc
that connects two different boundary components of an Si, which are "pointed in
different directions". But this is obviously impossible, as our Pk is
restricted to be in a single boundary component, so up to homotopy it must be
generated by those two I-bundle pages only.

This completes the proof.

\section{Some generalizations}

We use the following general notation for books of I-bundles. Let Mc1,...,Mcm
be the spines, all solid tori. Let M1,...,Mn be the pages, all thickened
surfaces. Each Mi has boundary components Ai1,...,Aiki all annuli. We glue each
annulus to a boundary annulus on some spine. For each spine, all these gluing
annuli must be disjoint and parallel. We can assume without loss of generality
that all pages have negative Euler characteristic, and all spines have at least
3 pages glued to them (otherwise, just consolidate into fewer pages / spines).

Given such a book of I-bundles M, let G=(V,E) be the graph associated to the
embedded surface A = Ui,j Aij in M which is the union of all the page gluing
annuli. Combinatorially, G has a vertex for each spine or page, and an edge for
each gluing of a page to a spine along an annulus. We call G the gluing graph
of the book of I-bundles.

We say a book of I-bundles M is tree-shaped if its gluing graph is a tree.

Conjecture. Let M be a tree-shaped book of I-bundles. Suppose P has no
components P0 in d+Mi or d-Mi for some i. Then there exists a surface
satisfying (*).

We're almost certain that this is true. It should just be a hairy inductive
adaptation of the above argument.

Theorem. Let M be a tree-shaped book of I-bundles. Suppose P has no components
P0 in d+Mi or d-Mi for some i - that is, every component of P crosses at least
one gluing circle of the boundary component it's on. Suppose further that every
component of P crosses at least one gluing circle at a spine where at least
4 pages are attached. Then there exists a surface satisfying (*).

In particular, note that if all spines are at least valence 4, the technical
crossing condition must be satisfied.

Proof.

Our construction of S is very simple. In fact, in this case, S embeds in our
book of I-bundles. Construct S by starting with a single page's core surface,
and traversing the tree-shaped gluing as follows. For each boundary component
of S, look at the valence of the associated spine. If it's valence 3, choose an
arbitrary one of the other two pages. If it's valence at least 4, choose a page
that's non-boundary-adjacent to S, in that neither boundary component of the
incoming page attaches to a boundary component of the newly chosen page when we
glue the book of I-bundles. This is always possible for valence at least 4,
because at a spine, each incoming boundary component connects to a single
outgoing boundary component, and there are only 2 incoming boundary components
but at least 3 new pages to choose from. Attach the core surface of the chosen
page to S with an annulus across the core. Since M is tree-shaped, we can build
S inductively without it running into itself.

We claim S satisfies (*). S is immediately properly immersed (in fact,
embedded) and pi1-injective, as it's a union of page cores and spine annuli. It
suffices to check the pared locus. Suppose some Pk had pi1S intersect pi1Pk neq
1, ie some multiple of its core curve was homotopic into S. By the crossing
condition, Pk must traverse a gluing circle on a spine of valence at least 4.
But at such a spine, Pk, which is contained in a boundary component of M, must
connect two boundary-adjacent pages. But we chose S so it would
connect at such a spine to a non-boundary-adjacent page. Since M is
tree-shaped, applying van Kampen shows that these pages correspond to
different pieces of the amalgamated free product for pi1M, so it's impossble
for this curve to be in pi1S. This completes the proof.

Finally, we have one more technical intermediate result. We hoped this would
extend to more cases, but we haven't been able to do anything with it yet.

Let M be a book of I-bundles. Associated to every surface we construct in an
analogous way to what we've been doing (taking covers of the page core surfaces
and gluing them together), there's a set of fairly complicated graphs we can
construct as follows. For each (Mi,Aij,Sitilde), where Mi is a page, Aij gluing
annulus of that page, and Sitilde finite-sheeted cover of the page core
surface, we can draw a local pared-arc graph G=G(Mi,Aij,Sitilde).

The vertices are boundary components of Sitilde which sit above Aij. Two
vertices are connected by an edge if there is an arc in the pared locus which
lifts to connect those two boundary components. For instance, a double cover of
the punctured torus page, with 3 disjoint non-parallel arcs on each boundary,
has a graph, over the single boundary annulus downstairs,  with 2 vertices and
3 edges (one between the two vertices, and one loop at each vertex). This graph
is a generalization of the cis-trans terminology we used in that example.

We say a cover Sitilde is pared-bipartite if each of its local pared-arc
graphs is bipartite. Note that none of the covers we constructed in our first
example are pared-bipartite. This is a very specialized condition. Note also
that if the pared locus does not intersect a page, all covers of that page are
pared-bipartite.

Theorem. Let M be a tree-shaped book of I-bundles. Suppose that P has no
components in d+Mi or d-Mi for any i. Suppose that every page of M has
a pared-bipartite cover of its core surface. Then M contains a surface
satisfying (*).

Proof.

First observe that every cover of a pared-bipartite cover is itself
pared-bipartite. Simply lift the partition of the vertices to obtain a new
partition of each local pared-arc graph. The arcs cannot break this
partition because otherwise they wouldn't cover arcs in the downstairs cover.

Choose a sufficiently large cover of a pared-bipartite cover of each page such
that at each spine, the number of incoming cover boundary components above each
incident page equal for that spine. We can do this taking a "least common
multiple cover", unless pages are glued to the same spine multiple times. In
that case, choose a finite-sheeted cover of the book of I-bundles itself that
doesn't have this issue, lift the pared locus, and construct a surface there.
Afterwards, we can push it down and it will still satisfy (*).

Now, we construct S by gluing these large covers. For each Sitilde and
downstairs gluing annulus Aij there will be two adjacent annuli in the
associated spine. For each Sitilde, attach half the boundary components above
Aij to the boundary components coming from each of the "neighboring" Sitilde,
via annuli. Use the pared-bipartite structure to split the set of boundary
components above Aij in half. Since the number of incoming boundary components
match at each spine, as constructed above, the boundary components will match
up. We have a "cover boundary component bipartition" above each Aij. Note that
once we have the bipartition, the details of how we glue the pieces inside the
bipartition are irrelevant.

We claim the resulting S satisfies (*). We already know it's proper immersed
pi1-injective by the same arguments. To show it doesn't overlap with the pared
locus, observe that by the definition of local pared-arc graphs, every core
curve in the pared structure must correspond to a sequence of arcs in covers,
where each arc either connects boundary components above different annuli Aij,
Aij', or it connects 2 boundary components above the same annulus Aij. But it
cannot connect two boundary components above the same annulus, as we glued
those according to the pared bipartition in such a way that the pared arc
component, which is locally restricted to a single boundary component of the
I-bundles, can't follow. This is a generalization of the first argument in our
simplest case.

Note that if the arc connects boundary components above different annuli, these
annuli must attach to different spines (by our earlier simplifying assumption).
But now because M is tree-shaped, no arc that's been redirected toward
different spines can possibly form a closed loop. This completes the proof.

We tried to do this proof in the non-tree-shaped case, but it doesn't work!
There are counterexamples of pared-bipartite covers where the obvious fix
relies on messy combinatorics inside the boundary component matching.

\section{Our first example}

Let $M$ be the book of I-bundles obtained by attaching 3 thickened
once-punctured tori to a single spine (a solid torus), in such a way that the
attaching maps all wrap around the solid torus longitude exactly once). That
is, we attach the thickened boundary component of the tori along 3 parallel
annuli representing a generator of $\pi(core)$. This is the simplest nontrivial
book of I-bundles available for us to study. That is, it's a book of I-bundles
that isn't itself an I-bundle, which will be homotopic to a surface, hence
Fuchsian. Notice that $M$ has 3 boundary components, each a closed genus
2 surface.

A pared 3-manifold structure on $M$ will consist of a union of disjoint
non-parallel simple closed curves on each of the three boundary components of
$M$. Cut along the 3 gluing annuli, breaking each boundary component into
2 pieces (glued along a circle where they meet the core). Each piece is
a once-punctured torus, ie, one of the boundaries of the corresponding
I-bundle page. Using Dehn-Thurston coordinates and other general facts about
curves on surfaces, we can compute that at most 3 disjoint non-parallel
proper arcs can be drawn on a punctured torus. Of course, since we began with
3 disjoint non-parallel curves on a genus two surface and then cut the
surface in half, we may have more than 3 arcs on our punctured torus.
However, since all the arcs are disjoint and properly embedded, they will
necessarily break up into at most
3 disjoint families, and all the arcs in each family will be parallel.

However, we should first observe that any simple closed curve that isn't cut by
this separation - ie, that is contained only in a single I-bundle - means that
that page is useless for our purposes. Any surface that contained
a homotopically nontrivial piece inside that page would, by Agol's Lemma, be
a cover, to which a closed curve would obviously always lift. So no
quasifuchsian surface subgroup can pass through such a page, and we might as
well "cross it off" entirely. (It's not entirely clear what this means? We
can't actually solve it otherwise - can we? Should be clear about when crossing
it off still lets us have a solution vs when it's impossible - clear up
conjecture above). So we'll only consider books of I-bundles which don't have
such curves.

IN THIS BOOK OF I-BUNDLES, if we have such a curve, cutting out that page
yields just a single (thickened) surface. So if there is even a single other
parabolic, we're sunk. Otherwise, that surface (or a cover of it) will yield
a desired quasifuchsian subgroup.

Now it suffices to draw a specific example of these arcs and their lifting
behavior. Since there exists a homeomorphism of the pnctured torus rel boundary
taking these 3 arcs to any other set of 3 arcs, passing through this
homeomorphism will give us a corresponding cover for any desired set of 3 arcs.

Looking at this set (see picture), the trick is that of the 3 connected double
covers of the punctured torus (corresponding to the 3 nontrivial maps of piS1,1
to Z/2, based on where the generators go), each cover lifts two of the arcs to
"trans" arcs and one to a "cis" arc. I should probably use different words for
these but these seem clear enough.

So, we have (at most) 3 arc families on each punctured torus. These are
identified, somehow, with 3 arc families on the other punctured torus, which
together makes up the genus two boundary component. Looking at our book of
I-bundles overall, we will choose a double cover of each I-bundle piece. This
gives us 6 cover mouths that need to be identified at the one core. We will do
the simplest approach and identify them "in a circle", ie, one edge of each
cover will match with one of the other two covers, and the other with the
other. See diagram. Note that it doesn't matter which mouth of each cover we
choose to point which way, because that just modifies the local picture by
a covering transformation.

To ensure this avoids the parabolic curves, we just need to choose which double
cover to take over each I-bundle so that the "cis" arcs don't match up. Notice
that the trans arcs cannot possibly connect up, because they'll connect
2 different mouths of a double cover, and the other mouth points toward the 3rd
I-bundle component which our chosen parabolic curve cannot reach! (because our
parabolic curve is stuck on a given boundary component of the book, it can only
reach 2 of the 3 I-bundles).

Arbitrarily choose a double cover of E1. Looking at the (at most) 3 parabolic
locus curves on the E1-E2 boundary, we can see that at most one curve contains
no trans arc segments (each curve has to have at least one segment in E1, or
we'd hit the trivial nonexistence as earlier).

\section{More general stuff}

Ian Agol chose to study books of I-bundles - the other infinite volume cases
ought to be easier. What about acylindrical manifolds? Books of I-bundles are
somehow the opposite of acylindrical - they're glued together along a bunch of
cylinders (ie annuli). If we can address the acylindrical and book of I-bundle
cases we ought to be able to put these together to solve the entire problem.
Agol told me (at some point) that the acylindrical case should be easier, but
I don't remember what strategy he had or why this should be true.
