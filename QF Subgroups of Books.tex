\begin{abstract} Given a Kleinian group $G$, one can ask whether the group
contains any quasifuchsian surface subgroups. Equivalently, given a pared
hyperbolic 3-manifold $(M,P)$, one can ask whether there exists a closed
immersed surface in $M$ that avoids the peripheral subgroups associated to $P$.
This question is already known for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds
(Kahn-Markovic), and for finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds (Masters-Zhang).
We derive explicit results for pared 3-manifolds $(M,P)$ where $M$ is a book of
I-bundles. \end{abstract}

\maketitle
\section{Introduction}

Let $M$ be a hyperbolic 3-manifold. $M$ has many possible realizations as
a Kleinian group $G$ quotient manifold. By work of Jorgensen (Characteristic
Submanifold theory?) the study of hyperbolic structures on a 3-manifold can be
reduced to studying pared 3-manifold structures on the boundary. The pared
structure gives data specifying the loci on the boundary corresponding to the
cusps of the Kleinian group / hyperbolic manifold.

To ask whether the Kleinian group contains a quasifuchsian subgroup in this
case boils down to asking whether we can find a closed immersed
$\pi_1$-injective surface which avoids these parabolics up to homotopy. That
is, we're trying to choose a surface subgroup of $G=\pi_1(M)$ which does not
contain any of the peripherial elements in the image of the embedding $P\to M$,
where $(M,P)$ is the pared 3-manifold structure with $P$ the parabolic locus.
Or any multiples of those elements.

There is some existing work related to this. Cooper, Long, and Reid addressed
the underlying topological problem, showing that a compact connected
irreducible 3-manifold with non-empty incompressible boundary  must contain an
essential closed surface, unless it's covered by a product $F\times I$.
However, this surface may contain accidental parabolics, and fail to be
quasifuchsian.  In the closed hyperbolic case, Kahn and Markovic proved that
there always exists an immersed closed hyperbolic $\pi_1$-injective surface in
any closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. Such a surface is necessarily quasifuchsian
because the hyperbolic 3-manifold is closed, hence contains no parabolics.
Finally, Baker and Cooper (re-proving work of Masters and Zhang) showed that
every finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold with cusps contains a quasifuchsian
subgroup.

The remaining case is infinite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. So far we've only
addressed a particular example of this case.

% XXX figure out if I need the Fathi-Laudenbach-Poenaru stuff or not. Right now
% it looks like I don't, at least for the cases I've done so far. But it might
% come in handy later for more complicated pages? Not sure.

%\section{Background details}
%
%These are some background facts that we'll need to go through the examples in
%detail.
%
%Arcs in surfaces with boundary - from Fathi-Laudenback-Poenaru, Exposes 2 and
%4 (see p. 21-24, 43-52).
%This is an exposition of coordinates for classes of arcs in a surface
%with boundary, aka Dehn-Thurston coordinates.
%
%Let A(N) be the set of isotopy classe sof simple closed proper arcs I\in N such
%that they represent nontrivial elements of pi1 rel boundary. We isotope them
%with the ends of the arcs free to move within the boundary components they are
%contained in. Similarly A'(N) with simple closed multi-arcs, up to isotopy.
%
%Theorem (FLP 2.11). Let P2 be the standard pair of pants. A(P2) consists of
%exactly six elements, classified by the boundary components of their endpoints.
%
%Theorem (FLP 2.12). A'(P2) is isomorphic to
%A'={(a1,a2,a3) in Z | sum ai is even }
%via the map
%i:A'(P2)->A'
%i(tau) = (i(tau, d1),i(tau,d2),i(tau,d3)) where d1,d2,d3 are the boundary
%components of P2, and i(,) is geometric intersection number.
%
%That is, simple closed multicurves exist and are uniquely determined, for each
%choice of boundary intersection numbers of the correct parity.
%
%Finally, given a closed surface, let N, let S(N) be the set of isotopy classes
%of simple closed curves on N, and S'(N) simple closed multicurves.
%
%Theorem (FLP 4.8). Let N be a closed surface of negative Euler characteristic.
%Fix a pants decomposition of N into 2g-2 pairs of pants along 3g-3 disjoint
%simple closed curves K1,...,K3g-3. Then
%
%S'(N) is isomorphic to B0 = {(mi,si,ti) in Z, i = 1,...,3g-3 | all coords >= 0,
%and for each pair of pants the corresponding mi sum is even}
%where the mi measure intersection numbers with the curves K1,...,K3g-3, and the
%si,ti measure twisting around at each intersection curve as a rational number.
%See FLP for details of the calculation of the twisting coordinates - we won't
%be needing it here (at least, not yet!).
%
%We actually require a slight generalization of this result, but the proof is
%identical.
%
%Theorem. Let SA'(N) be the set of disjoint multi-curves or arcs on N, a surface
%possibly with boundary. That is, each element of SA'(N) corresponds to a union
%of simple closed curves and simple arcs on N, all disjoint, such that the arcs
%are properly embedded, up to isotopy where the arcs are permitted to slide on
%each boundary component. Then SA'(N) is isomorphic to the obvious choice, where
%we again decompose into pairs of pants, have mi for each boundary curve or
%decomposition curve, but si,ti only for each decomposition curve.
%
%Finally, let A''(N) (or maybe some better notation, etc) be the set of simple
%proper multi-arcs satisfying the condition that no two components of the
%multi-arc are parallel, ie, isotopic. Alternatively we can think of A''(N) as
%consisting of simplices in the arc complex of N, or as a quotient of A'(N)
%where we identify multicurves along splitting / joining of parallel arcs. In
%general, A''(N) is more difficult to parametrize, as purely from the
%coordinates it is difficult to determine which multicurves or multiarcs will
%contain parallel components.
%
%We define S''(N), SA''(N) similarly.
%
%Example. Consider the pair of pants P2. We know A(P2) has 6 elements, so
%A''(P2) has at most 2**6 elements, corresponding to which arcs are present in
%our multi-arc. It suffices to check that all 6 arcs can be
%embedded in P2 without intersecting.
%
%Example. Consider the punctured torus \Si_{1,}. We first compute SA'(\Si_{1,1}). By the
%generalized Dehn-Thurston coordinates theorem above, (work this out on paper
%first)

\section{More background - pared manifolds and stuff}

%Definition and important facts about pared manifolds. After Morgan, The Smith
%Conjecture, V ("Uniformization Theorem for Three-Dimensional Manifolds"),
%p 58-60. Or Canary-McCullough, Homotopy Equivalences of 3-Manifolds and
%Deformation Theory of Kleinian Groups, Ch 5 p. 87-92. Also Ch 7 p.105-107.
%Note that Canary-McCullough is much more recent.
%
%(Morgan p58) (Canary-McCullough p87)
\begin{Def}

A \emph{pared manifold} $(M,P)$ is a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold
$M$, together with $P\cin\bd M$, such that the following conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every component of $P$ is a torus or annulus, incompressible in $M$.
\item Every noncyclic abelian subgroup of $\pi_1M$ is peripheral with respect to
$P$ --
ie, conjugate to the fundamental group of a component of $P$.
\item $(M,P)$ is ``annulus-incompressible'': every $\pi_1$-injective map $(A^2,
\bd A^2) \to
(M,P)$ is homotopic (as a map of pairs) to a map into $P$.
\end{enumerate}

We call $P$ the \emph{pared locus} or \emph{parabolic locus} of the pared
manifold $(M,P)$.

\end{Def}

Note that there are a few pared manifolds that are special cases,
like with elementary Kleinian groups. In fact, these are precisely the pared
manifolds that correspond to elementary Kleinian groups when we construct pared
3-manifolds from Kleinian groups below.

%(Canary-McCullough p88)
\begin{Def}

A pared manifold $(M,P)$ is \emph{elementary} if it is homeomorphic (as a pair)
to one of the following: $(T^2\x I,T^2\x 0)$, $(A^2\x I,A^2\x 0)$, or $(A^2\x
I,\emptyset)$.
%(or (Morgan only) (S3,empty)).

\end{Def}

%(Morgan p59, Canary-McCullough p88)
\begin{prop}

Let $(M,P)$ nonelementary. The following facts hold:

%In fact, Canary-McCullough makes these 3 statements. Morgan only has the 4th.
\begin{enumerate}
\item M is not a $T^2\x I$, $K^2$ $I$-bundle, or $A^2\x I$ (solid torus).
\item M does not contain an embedded $K^2$
\item For every component $Q$ of $P$, $\pi_1Q$ is a maximal abelian subgroup of
$\pi_1M$.
\item Every component of $\bd M-P$ has negative Euler characteristic.
% Yes this is correct. But the only extra info we get is that there's no
% parallel annuli. Canary-McCullough includes the statement:
% "Every toroidal component of dM is contained in P"
% but this is redundant with item 4 above (from Morgan)
\end{enumerate}

\end{prop}

Pared manifolds arise naturally in the study of Kleinian groups. Given
a geometrically finite torsion-free Kleinian group $G$, we construct $(M,P)$ by
truncating small neighborhoods of the cusps of the quotient manifold $M(G)
= \left(\mathbb{H}^3\cup \Om(G)\right)/G$.  Then we let $M$ be the resulting
compact manifold with boundary, and $P$ the boundary locus along which we
truncated.  That is, we can rebuild the quotient manifold from $(M,P)$ by
gluing cusp neighborhoods onto each component of $P$. It follows from basic
Kleinian group theory that the resulting $(M,P)$ will satisfy conditions 1-3
above, making it a pared manifold.  The parabolic elements of $G$ precisely
correspond to (conjugacy classes of) the peripheral subgroups $\pi_1P$ in
$\pi_1M$.

Conversely, Thurston's famous uniformization theorem states that for every
pared manifold $(M,P)$ with $M$ Haken, there exists a finite volume (in
particular, geometrically finite) hyperbolic 3-manifold structure on the
interior satisfying the appropriate conditions for a pared 3-manifold! To be
precise:

%(see Morgan for details of this construction)

%(Morgan p60, but his statement is confusing / less modern definitions. He does
%state the more general theorem for Haken pared manifolds though.)
%(Canary-McCullough p105-106)

\begin{thm}

If $(M,P)$ is an oriented pared 3-manifold with nonempty boundary, then
there exists a geometrically finite uniformization of $(M,P)$, that is, a map
$\rho: \pi_1M \to \PSL_2\mathbb{C}$ such that $\rho(g)$ is parabolic if $g \in
\pi_1(P)$, and an
orientation-preserving homeomorphism $M-P \to \left(\mathbb{H}^3
\cup \Om(\rho(\pi_1M))\right)/\rho(\pi_1M)$.

\end{thm}

See discussion on (CMc p106, bottom of page) for why this definition of
geometrically finite is equivalent to the standard one.

Example. Maybe? % XXX TODO

\section{Our reduction}

In our result, we study the problem of finding quasifuchsian surface subgroups
of Kleinian groups from the topological perspective. We convert our given
Kleinian group to a pared 3-manifold, and look for surface subgroups of this
Kleinian group that avoid the peripheral pared structure. Finding
a quasifuchsian surface subgroup of a Kleinian group is reduced by the
following theorem:

%(Baker-Cooper Theorem 1.7 - "work of Bonahon and Thurston").
\begin{thm}

Let $M$ be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with finite volume, and $S$
a closed oriented $\pi_1$-injective immersed surface of negative Euler
characteristic. Then either $S$ is a virtual fiber, or $S$ is geometrically
finite. In the second case, it's either quasifuchsian or some element of
$\pi_1S$ is parabolic.

\end{thm}

We assume this reduction still works in our cases (which are not finite
volume). I hope some reference to Thurston can fix this.

So in our case, since the parabolic elements precisely correspond to the pared
structure, our problem becomes a purely topological one: can we find a closed
immersed $\pi_1$-injective surface of negative Euler characteristic, that
doesn't contain any of the pared locus, up to homotopy?

Since we're working in the case of books of $I$-bundles, we can reduce the pared
locus by observing that there are no torus boundary components of M, so all the
components of the pared locus must be annuli (as they're $\pi_1$-injective). For
each annulus, since we're only concerned with its homotopy class, it suffices
to consider the core curve.

\section{Our first example}

We construct a book of $I$-bundles $M$ as follows. In the following we take
$\Si_{1,1}$ to be the compact surface of genus 1 with a single boundary
component, a circle.  Abusing terminology slightly, we'll call this the
punctured torus.  Let $M_1$,$M_2$,$M_3$ be 3 punctured torus I-bundles,
$M_1=M_2=M_3=\Si_{1,1}\x I$. For each $M_i$, write
\[
\bd M_i = \bd \Si_{1,1}\x I \cup \Si_{1,1}\x0 \cup \Si_{1,1} \x 1
\]
and label these boundary pieces as
\[
\bd M_i = A_i \cup \bd_- M_i \cup \bd_+M_i
\].

Let $M_c = S^1xD^2$ be a solid torus. Attach the $M_i$ to $M_c$ by gluing the
$A_i$ to parallel annuli in $\bd M_c$, each with longitudinal core curve. The
result is a compact 3-manifold with boundary. This is our $M$. We choose
orientations and a cyclic order for the gluing such that the 3 boundary
components of M are precisely
\[
\bd M = (\bd_+M_1 \cup_{S^1} \bd_-M_2) \sqcup (\bd_+M_2 \cup_{S^1} \bd_-M_3)
\sqcup (\bd_+M_3 \cup_{S^1} \bd_-M_1)
\]
and label these
\[
\bd M=\bd_{12}M \sqcup \bd_{23}M \sqcup \bd_{31}M
\].
Each boundary
component of $M$ consists of two punctured tori glued along their boundary
circles, topologically a genus two surface.

We consider possible pared structures $P$ on $M$. Our goal is to find a closed
immersed $\pi_1$-injective surface $S$ in $M$ such that $\pi_1P_k \cap \pi_1S
= \emptyset$
for each component $P_k$ of $P$. We'll call this condition (*).
% XXX fix condition *

Note that since we
haven't fixed a basepoint, these subgroups are really only defined up to
conjugacy - what we're saying is they fail to intersect for an arbitrary choice
of conjugacy class for each subgroup. (ask Ian about this? seems fuzzy)

%("Ian's covering lemma")
\begin{lemma}

Let $S$ be a surface satisfying (*). Homotope
$S$ to have minimal intersection with each $A_i$, that is, so there are no "bumps".
Then for each $M_i$, each component of $S \cap M_i$ is a finite-sheeted covering
of the core surface. That is, given such a component $S' \cin M_i$, the map $S'
\to M_i = \Si_{1,1}\x I \to \Si_{1,1}\x{1/2}$ is homotopic to a finite-sheeted covering
map. Conversely, given any finite-sheeted covering $\widetilde{S} \to \Si_{1,1}$, there
exists a corresponding proper immersed $\pi_1$-injective surface $S \cin \Si_{1,1}\x I$.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

$S$ is compact, so every such component $S'$ is a compact surface with
boundary, properly immersed in $M_i$. Since $S$ is $\pi_1$-injective in $M$, $S'$ must be
$\pi_1$-injective in $M_i$. Otherwise, we'd have a nontrivial element of $\pi_1S'$ which
is trivial in $\pi_1M_i$, hence in $\pi_1M$, hence in $\pi_1S$, contradicting the minimal
position homotopy above. So the map $\phi : S'\to\Si_{1,1}\x{1,2}$ is also $\pi_1$-injective,
since $M_i$ deformation retracts to its core. Let $H = \phi_*(\pi_1S')$, and let
$\Si_{1,1}^H$
be the cover of $\Si_{1,1}$ associated to $H<\pi_1\Si_{1,1}$. $\phi$ lifts to
$\widetilde{\phi}\colon S'\to
\Si_{1,1}^H$. This is a proper map of compact surfaces which is an isomorphism
on $\pi_1$.
By the classification of surfaces, it must be homotopic (as a proper map) to
a homeomorphism. So $\phi$ is homotopic to a covering map. It must be
finite-sheeted as $S'$ is compact (by classification of surfaces again).

Conversely, given a finite-sheeted cover $Stilde \to \Si_{1,1}$, compose with the
embedding $\Si_{1,1} = \Si_{1,1}\x{1/2} \cin \Si_{1,1}\x I$. This is proper and $\pi_1$-injective.
Perturb locally to obtain an immersion.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}

Let $P$ be a pared structure on $M$. $P$ cannot contain any tori. That is,
$P$ consists entirely of annuli.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

We can compute $\pi_1M$ directly from the van Kampen theorem. Let $a_i,b_i$ be
the generators of $\pi_1(M_i)$, and $c$ be the generator of $\pi_1(M_c)$. Our gluing yields
$\pi_1(M) = <a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3,c| [a_1,b_1]=[a_2,b_2]=[a_3,b_3]=c>$. It immediately
follows that $\pi_1M$ contains no rank 2 abelian subgroups, as no two elements
commute. Since every component of $P$ is $\pi_1$-injective, they must all be annuli.

\end{proof}

\begin{prop}

Suppose $P$ contains a component $P_0$ that, up to homotopy, is
contained entirely within one "I-bundle half" of a boundary component. That is,
$P_0 in \bd M_i$, for some i. Without loss of generality we can let $P_0 in
\bd M_1$. Then
there exists a surface satisfying (*) if and only if $P$ contains no components
that are (up to homotopy) contained in $\bd M_2 \cup \bd M_3 = \bd_-M_2 \sqcup
\bd_{23}M \sqcup \bd_+M_3$.

\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

(<=) Take $S=\bd_{23}M$. Intuitively, it's easy to see that the conditions on
$P$ force all its components to lie on surfaces where they can't be homotoped
into $S$.

Algebraically, $\pi_1S$ is the subgroup generated by
$a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3 in \pi_1M$. $\pi_1S = <a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3 | [a_2,b_3]=[a_3,b_3]>$. $P$ contains no
components in $\bd_{23}M$, so an arbitrary component $P_k$ of $P$  must be contained in
$\bd_{12}M$ or $\bd_{31}M$, which have fundamental groups generated by $(a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2)$ and
$(a_3,b_3,a_1,b_1)$ respectively. $\pi_1P_k$ is cyclic, so let $g$ be its generator. No
matter if it's contained in $\bd_{12}M$ or $\bd_{31}M$, we can see that in order for
$\pi_1P_k$ to
overlap with $\pi_1S$, it must have generator some word in $a_2,b_2$ (if $P_k in
\bd_{12}M$),
or some word in $a_3,b_3$ (if $P_k in \bd_{31}M$). In either case, this is precisely the
condition for such a word to correspond to a curve contained in $\bd M_2$ or $\bd M_3$,
respectively, contradicting our assumption on $P$.

(=>) Let $S$ be a surface satisfying (*). Cut $S$ into components in $M_1,M_2,M_3$
(after homotoping to minimal intersections with the annuli). Applying Ian's
covering lemma, we can see that $S \cap M_1 = empty$, as otherwise since it's
a finite-sheeted cover it would have to contain a multiple of $P_0$.
So $S in M_2 \cup M_3 \cup M_c$, which is homeomorphic to $S_2 \x I$. Deformation retracting
this to a surface $S_2$ and applying a covering argument like in Ian's lemma, we
can see that $S$ is a cover of $S_2$. Since it's a finite-sheeted cover, it will
have to have $\pi_1$ intersecting any component $P_k$ that violates the conditions
stated above. This completes the proof.

\end{proof}

\begin{thm}

Let $P$ be a pared structure containing no components $P_0$ as in the above
proposition. Then there exists a surface satisfying (*).

\end{thm}

This is the main theorem we prove for this example. A few preliminary facts are
required. Note that we can first isotope P such that it's in minimal position
on each boundary component with respect to the gluing circle.

\begin{lemma}

Under the hypotheses of the theorem, each "I-bundle half" $P \cap
\bd_+M_i$ (or $\bd_-M_i$) is a thickening of a set of disjoint essential arcs, each arc
connecting $d(\bd_+M_i)$ to itself. The arcs form at most 3 "bands", where all the
arcs in each band are parallel.  Furthermore, if we choose a representative arc
from each band (yielding a set of at most 3 disjoint non-parallel arcs in
$\Si_{1,1}$), there exists an automorphism of $\Si_{1,1}$ taking these arcs to a standard set
of 3 disjoint non-parallel arcs.  See diagram for an illustration of the
standard set.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

We first need a preliminary definition. After cutting a surface with
boundary along arcs, we'll obtain one or more connected surfaces, each with one
or more boundary components. Each boundary component after cutting will have
pieces from the original boundary as well as pieces from the arcs that we cut
along. Given labels $\gamma_1,...,\gamma_k$ for the boundary components and
$\alpha_1,...,\alpha_l$ for the arcs (on the original surface with boundary), we can
describe each boundary component of the cut surfaces as a union of arcs, each
labeled with $\gamma_1,...,\gamma_k,\alpha_1,...,\alpha_l$. We call this an arc pattern
for that boundary.

We first show that $\Si_{1,1}$ admitts at most 3 disjoint essential non-parallel arcs,
and the possible surfaces and arc patterns obtained by cutting along these arcs
are very restricted.

Label the boundary component of $\Si_{1,1}$ by $\gamma$. Consider a proper essential arc
$\alpha_1 in \Si_{1,1}$. Fix an orientation for $\alpha_1$. Since $\Si_{1,1}$ is orientable, we can
look at local neighborhoods of $\alpha_1$ and see that $\alpha_1$ has a well-defined
"left side" and "right side" as we travel along it. Looking at the endpoints of
$\alpha_1$ along $\gamma$, we are forced to connect certain endpoints in the cut-up
$\gamma$ with $\alpha_1$, in order to preserve the parity. This tells us the (possibly
disconnected) cut surface $S_1$ will have two boundary components. Each will have
an arc pattern consisting of two arcs, one labeled $\gamma$ and one labeled
$\alpha_1$.

Since we cut along a properly embedded arc, the Euler characteristic increases
by one. $x(S_1)=0$ and $S_1$ has two boundary components. By classification of
surfaces, $S_1 = \Si_{0,2}$ or $\Si_{0,1} \sqcup \Si_{1,1}$. But if $S_1$ contained a disk with the arc
pattern described above, embedding that disk back in $\Si_{1,1}$ would describe
a homotopy of $\alpha_1$ into the boundary. So $S_1 = \Si_{0,2}$.

Now suppose we had a second proper essential arc $\alpha_2 in \Si_{1,1}$, disjoint from
and non-parallel to $\alpha_1$. Since it's disjoint from $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$ induces
a proper arc in $S_1$ which connects two regions in the arc pattern labeled
$\gamma$.
$\alpha_2$ must have one endpoint on each boundary component of $S_1$. If both are on
the same side, it's either homotopic to the boundary of $\Si_{1,1}$ or parallel to
$\alpha_1$. Cutting along $\alpha_2$ yields a new surface $S_2$. Topologically
$S_2=D2$, with
arc pattern consisting of 8 components in the cyclic order
$(\gamma,\alpha_1,\gamma,\alpha_2,\gamma,\alpha_1,\gamma,\alpha_2)$.

Finally, adding our 3rd proper essential arc $\alpha_3$, disjoint and non-parallel
to the first two arcs, a similar argument shows that $\alpha_3$ must connect
opposite $\gamma$ pieces in the arc pattern. Cutting along $\alpha_3$ yields two disks
with the same arc pattern. Depending on the choice of $\alpha_3$, the arc pattern
on these disks is either $(\gamma,\alpha_1,\gamma,\alpha_2,\gamma,\alpha_3)$ or
$(\gamma,\alpha_1,\gamma,\alpha_3,\gamma,\alpha_2)$. So up to relabeling
$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3$, cutting along 3 proper essential disjoint non-parallel
arcs has only one possible choice of cut surfaces and arc patterns.

Observe that it is not possible to add any more disjoint non-parallel arcs. In
particular, any arc we draw between $\gamma$ components of the arc pattern on
either disk is homotopic to the boundary or parallel to an existing arc.
Furthermore, if we add new disjoint arcs and allow them to be parallel, we can
see that they must form "bands" around the existing 3 arcs in order to remain
disjoint. That is, we can homotope all the arcs parallel to a given arc into
a small neighborhood of that arc in the disk, without intersecting any of the
non-parallel arcs.

We claim there exists an automorphism of $\Si_{1,1}$ taking any set of 3 such arcs to
any other set (in particular, to the standard set, as illustrated). Since there
is only one topological result of cutting along the arcs, choose
a homeomorphism of the cut surfaces. Up to relabeling the arcs, we can choose
a homeomorphism that identifies matching arcs in the arc patterns (as shown
above, there is only one possible arc pattern up to relabeling). Glue both
sides along the arcs to obtain the desired automorphism of $\Si_{1,1}$.

We now consider $P \cap \bd_+M_i in \bd_+M_i = \Si_{1,1}$. As shown, $P$ is a union of
annuli. By the assumptions of the theorem, no annulus of $P$ is contained in
$\bd_+M_i$, so each annulus intersects $\bd_+M_i$ in a union of rectangles, where two sides
of the rectangle are embedded in the boundary $d(\bd_+M_i)$. Since we homotoped $P$ to
have minimal intersections, all the core arcs of the rectangles (pieces of the
core curve of the annulus) must be essential. They are disjoint by definition
of $P$. The statement of the lemma follows from applying the above argument to
these core arcs.

\end{proof}

We consider a connected cover $\widetilde{\Si_{1,1}} -> \Si_{1,1} homeom \bd_+M_i (or
\bd_-M_i)$ with two
boundary components. Every core arc (as in above lemma) of $P \cap \bd_+M_i$
lifts to arcs in $\widetilde{\Si_{1,1}}$. We say such an arc is cis for a given cover if
both endpoints of any (ie all) lifts of that arc lie in the same boundary
component upstairs. Otherwise, we say it's trans for that cover.

\begin{lemma}

Given any 3 disjoint non-parallel proper arcs in $\Si_{1,1}$, and any double
cover of $\Si_{1,1}$, 2 of the 3 arcs are trans, and the 3rd is cis.
Furthermore, we can choose any two of the three we wish to be trans with an
appropriate cover.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

As in earlier lemma, there exists an automorphism of $\Si_{1,1}$
taking these 3 arcs to the standard set of 3 disjoint non-parallel proper arcs.
Now it suffices to observe, by looking at relative first homology or just by
construction, that each of the three standard connected double covers
(corresponding to nonzero maps $Z2 -> Z/2$) makes two of the three arcs trans and
the third cis.

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}

Since $P$ has no components $P_0$, every $P \cap \bd_+M_i$ is a union of thickened
arcs (that is, there are no full annulus components in any $\bd_+M_i$ or $\bd_-M_i$). Apply
the first lemma to break these into bands. The problem is most constrained when
there are 3 bands, so we'll consider that case (if there are fewer than 3, just
draw some more arcs on that component arbitrarily, and the proof still works).

We will build our surface $S$ by taking a double cover of the core $\Si_{1,1}$ surface
for each I-bundle page $M_1,M_2,M_3$. Call these covers $S_1,S_2,S_3$. Each of these has
two boundary components. We'll then attach the boundary components such that
each of $S_1,S_2,S_3$ has exactly one boundary component connected to each of the
others. See diagram.

Choose an arbitrary connected double cover for $S_1$. We can view this as a cover
of $\bd_+M_1$ or $\bd_-M_1$, deformation retracting either way. By the lemma, two of the
3 bands on $\bd_+M_1$ are trans, and the other is cis. The same holds for $\bd_-M_1$.

We cannot choose $S_2$ arbitrarily, as a cis arc for $S_1$ in $\bd_+M_1$ may connect
(in $S$)
to a cis arc for $S_2$ in $\bd_-M_2$. These together would form a closed curve that
lifts to $S$, which once $S$ is immersed in $M$ will yield a violation of condition
(*). Instead, observe that there is at most one band of the three in $\bd_-M_2$
containing arcs that, when glued across the core circle, match up to arcs in
the cis band of $\bd_+M_1$ to form closed curves containing only arcs in those two
bands. This is because once one band has that behavior, by endpoint parity the
vertices can't also match up for a different band, if the arcs they have to
match with on the other side are parallel. Looking at the boundary circle,
non-parallel arcs have endpoints in cyclic order, but parallel arcs don't). See
diagram. It suffices to check this for our standard set of non-parallel arcs,
by the same automorphism argument.

Since there is only one such band on $\bd_-M_2$, choose $S_2$ such that this band is not
cis.  Finally, for $S_3$ we have two connecting constraints. We have a cis band on
$\bd_-M_1$ from our choice of $S_1$, and a cis band on $\bd_+M_2$ from our choice of
$S_2$.
Applying the same argument, there is at most one band on $\bd_-M_3$ and one band on
$\bd_+M_3$ that will connect to form closed curves. But we can choose $S_3$ such that
both of these bands are trans. (This requires a slight modification to the
lemma - since these bands are on different boundary surfaces, they may not be
disjoint non-parallel. If they aren't disjoint, we can tweak them by local
modifications so they are, and then "untweak" them in the cover. If they are
parallel, just ignore one set of bands)

Glue $S_1,S_2,S_3$ as described to obtain $S$. We claim that $S$ satisfies condition
(*). $S$ is closed and immersed by construction (as in Ian's covering lemma). It
is $\pi_1$-injective inside each I-bundle by Ian's covering lemma, and inside the
core $M_c$ because it's just a union of incompressible gluing annuli there. It
suffices to show that $\pi_1S \cap \pi_1P_k = 1$ for each component $P_k$ of the
pared locus. Looking at the core curve of the annulus $P_k$, this implies that
some multiple of that core curve is homotopic into $S$.

But this is impossibly by the above construction. Every such curve contains at
least two bands, on two different components $\bd_+-M_i$. By the construction of
$S$,
of any two bands which connect up when the boundary components are glued across
circles, at least one must be trans. This means that when we try to homotope
the core curve multiple into $S$, in order to follow along $S$ locally (in each
page, where $S$ is locally a cover of the core surface, it must be a lift from
that core surface) it would have to traverse between all three pieces of the
cover, as that's how we connected up the $Si$. Every trans arc lifts to an arc
that connects two different boundary components of an $Si$, which are "pointed in
different directions". But this is obviously impossible, as our $P_k$ is
restricted to be in a single boundary component, so up to homotopy it must be
generated by those two I-bundle pages only.

\end{proof}

\section{Some generalizations}

We use the following general notation for books of I-bundles. Let $M_c1,...,M_cm$
be the spines, all solid tori. Let $M_1,...,Mn$ be the pages, all thickened
surfaces. Each $M_i$ has boundary components $Ai1,...,Aiki$ all annuli. We glue each
annulus to a boundary annulus on some spine. For each spine, all these gluing
annuli must be disjoint and parallel. We can assume without loss of generality
that all pages have negative Euler characteristic, and all spines have at least
3 pages glued to them (otherwise, just consolidate into fewer pages / spines).

Given such a book of I-bundles $M$, let $G=(V,E)$ be the graph associated to the
embedded surface $A = Ui,j Aij in M$ which is the union of all the page gluing
annuli. Combinatorially, $G$ has a vertex for each spine or page, and an edge for
each gluing of a page to a spine along an annulus. We call $G$ the gluing graph
of the book of I-bundles.

We say a book of I-bundles is tree-shaped if its gluing graph is a tree.

\begin{conj}

% XXX This isn't my latest conjecture with the iterative process. FIXME
Let $M$ be a tree-shaped book of I-bundles. Suppose $P$ has no
components $P_0$ in $\bd_+M_i$ or $\bd_-M_i$ for some $i$. Then there exists a surface
satisfying (*).

\end{conj}

We're almost certain that this is true. It should just be a hairy inductive
adaptation of the above argument. In particular, it is totally unclear how

\begin{thm}

Let $M$ be a tree-shaped book of I-bundles. Suppose $P$ has no components
$P_0 in \bd_+M_i$ or $\bd_-M_i$ for some $i$ - that is, every component of $P$ crosses at least
one gluing circle of the boundary component it's on. Suppose further that every
component of $P$ crosses at least one gluing circle at a spine where at least
4 pages are attached. Then there exists a surface satisfying (*).

In particular, note that if all spines are at least valence 4, the technical
crossing condition must be satisfied.

\end{thm}
\begin{proof}

Our construction of $S$ is very simple. In fact, in this case, $S$ embeds in our
book of I-bundles. Construct $S$ by starting with a single page's core surface,
and traversing the tree-shaped gluing as follows. For each boundary component
of $S$, look at the valence of the associated spine. If it's valence 3, choose an
arbitrary one of the other two pages. If it's valence at least 4, choose a page
that's non-boundary-adjacent to $S$, in that neither boundary component of the
incoming page attaches to a boundary component of the newly chosen page when we
glue the book of I-bundles. This is always possible for valence at least 4,
because at a spine, each incoming boundary component connects to a single
outgoing boundary component, and there are only 2 incoming boundary components
but at least 3 new pages to choose from. Attach the core surface of the chosen
page to $S$ with an annulus across the core. Since $M$ is tree-shaped, we can build
$S$ inductively without it running into itself.

We claim $S$ satisfies (*). $S$ is immediately properly immersed (in fact,
embedded) and $\pi_1$-injective, as it's a union of page cores and spine annuli. It
suffices to check the pared locus. Suppose some $P_k$ had $\pi_1S \cap \pi_1P_k neq
1$, ie some multiple of its core curve was homotopic into $S$. By the crossing
condition, $P_k$ must traverse a gluing circle on a spine of valence at least 4.
But at such a spine, $P_k$, which is contained in a boundary component of $M$, must
connect two boundary-adjacent pages. But we chose $S$ so it would
connect at such a spine to a non-boundary-adjacent page. Since $M$ is
tree-shaped, applying van Kampen shows that these pages correspond to
different pieces of the amalgamated free product for $\pi_1M$, so it's impossble
for this curve to be in $\pi_1S$. This completes the proof.

\end{proof}

Finally, we have one more technical intermediate result. We hoped this would
extend to more cases, but we haven't been able to do anything with it yet.

Let $M$ be a book of I-bundles. Associated to every surface we construct in an
analogous way to what we've been doing (taking covers of the page core surfaces
and gluing them together), there's a set of fairly complicated graphs we can
construct as follows. For each $(M_i,A_{ij},\widetilde{S_i})$, where $M_i$ is a page, $Aij$ gluing
annulus of that page, and $\widetilde{S_i}$ finite-sheeted cover of the page core
surface, we can draw a local pared-arc graph $G=G(M_i,A_{ij},\widetilde{S_i})$.

The vertices are boundary components of $\widetilde{S_i}$ which sit above
$A_{ij}$. Two
vertices are connected by an edge if there is an arc in the pared locus which
lifts to connect those two boundary components. For instance, a double cover of
the punctured torus page, with 3 disjoint non-parallel arcs on each boundary,
has a graph, over the single boundary annulus downstairs,  with 2 vertices and
3 edges (one between the two vertices, and one loop at each vertex). This graph
is a generalization of the cis-trans terminology we used in that example.

We say a cover $\widetilde{S_i}$ is pared-bipartite if each of its local pared-arc
graphs is bipartite. Note that none of the covers we constructed in our first
example are pared-bipartite. This is a very specialized condition. Note also
that if the pared locus does not intersect a page, all covers of that page are
pared-bipartite.

\begin{thm}

Let $M$ be a tree-shaped book of I-bundles. Suppose that $P$ has no
components in $\bd_+M_i$ or $d-M_i$ for any $i$. Suppose that every page of $M$ has
a pared-bipartite cover of its core surface. Then $M$ contains a surface
satisfying (*).

\end{thm}
\begin{proof}

First observe that every cover of a pared-bipartite cover is itself
pared-bipartite. Simply lift the partition of the vertices to obtain a new
partition of each local pared-arc graph. The arcs cannot break this
partition because otherwise they wouldn't cover arcs in the downstairs cover.

Choose a sufficiently large cover of a pared-bipartite cover of each page such
that at each spine, the number of incoming cover boundary components above each
incident page equal for that spine. We can do this taking a "least common
multiple cover", unless pages are glued to the same spine multiple times. In
that case, choose a finite-sheeted cover of the book of I-bundles itself that
doesn't have this issue, lift the pared locus, and construct a surface there.
Afterwards, we can push it down and it will still satisfy (*).

Now, we construct $S$ by gluing these large covers. For each $\widetilde{S_i}$ and
downstairs gluing annulus $Aij$ there will be two adjacent annuli in the
associated spine. For each $\widetilde{S_i}$, attach half the boundary components above
$Aij$ to the boundary components coming from each of the "neighboring"
$\widetilde{S_i}$,
via annuli. Use the pared-bipartite structure to split the set of boundary
components above $Aij$ in half. Since the number of incoming boundary components
match at each spine, as constructed above, the boundary components will match
up. We have a "cover boundary component bipartition" above each $Aij$. Note that
once we have the bipartition, the details of how we glue the pieces inside the
bipartition are irrelevant.

We claim the resulting $S$ satisfies (*). We already know it's proper immersed
$\pi_1$-injective by the same arguments. To show it doesn't overlap with the pared
locus, observe that by the definition of local pared-arc graphs, every core
curve in the pared structure must correspond to a sequence of arcs in covers,
where each arc either connects boundary components above different annuli $Aij$,
$Aij'$, or it connects 2 boundary components above the same annulus $Aij$. But it
cannot connect two boundary components above the same annulus, as we glued
those according to the pared bipartition in such a way that the pared arc
component, which is locally restricted to a single boundary component of the
I-bundles, can't follow. This is a generalization of the first argument in our
simplest case.

Note that if the arc connects boundary components above different annuli, these
annuli must attach to different spines (by our earlier simplifying assumption).
But now because $M$ is tree-shaped, no arc that's been redirected toward
different spines can possibly form a closed loop. This completes the proof.

\end{proof}

We tried to do this proof in the non-tree-shaped case, but it doesn't work!
There are counterexamples of pared-bipartite covers where the obvious fix
relies on messy combinatorics inside the boundary component matching.

\section{More general stuff}

Ian Agol chose to study books of I-bundles - the other infinite volume cases
ought to be easier. What about acylindrical manifolds? Books of I-bundles are
somehow the opposite of acylindrical - they're glued together along a bunch of
cylinders (ie annuli). If we can address the acylindrical and book of I-bundle
cases we ought to be able to put these together to solve the entire problem.
Agol told me (at some point) that the acylindrical case should be easier, but
I don't remember what strategy he had or why this should be true.
