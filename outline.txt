Just some rough thoughts on overall sections. This is based on how I ended up
organizing my talks.

(First talk)
- Intro to problem, history etc
- Background
- Reduction of the general case

(Second talk - books of I-bundles)
- First Examples
- Reduction Proof
- Main Proof

- Extra material that I didn't delete yet
