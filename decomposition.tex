\section{Decomposition of pared 3-manifolds}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the geometrically finite case, we've reduced the quasi-Fuchsian surface
subgroup question to a topological problem about pi1-injective maps of
a surface into a pared 3-manifold. However, infinite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds may have quite complex topology, so it is not immediately clear how
to find such surfaces in the resulting pared 3-manifolds. It is not clear how
to find (QF) surfaces directly. Instead, we decompose the pared 3-manifold
along disks and annuli. While the precise statements and proofs that follow are
new, these are known facts and standard arguments.

First, a simple proposition.

prop

Let M be a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold. Let f colon S to M be
a pi1-injective map, where S is a closed surface.  Let D cin M be a compression
disk for bd M.  That is, D is properly embedded, and bd D does not bound a disk
in bd M.  Then f is homotopic to a map such that f(S) cap D = emptyset. Given
any finite collection of disjoint compression disks we can homotope f away from
all of them.

end prop

proof

Intuitively, f is pi1-injective, so any loop where S crosses D is contractible
in D, hence contractible in S. Then use irreducibility and an innermost disk
argument.

More precisely, we proceed as follows. First suppose f is not necessarily an
embedding. Homotope f locally so it's transverse to D. D is compact and
properly embedded, and S is compact, so f-1(D) is a properly embedded compact
submanifold of S. That is, it's a union of finitely many disjoint simple closed
curves alpha1,dots,alphak. For each alphai, f(alphai) cin D, so f(alphai) is
homotopically trivial in M.  Since f is pi1-injective, each alphai must be
homotopically trivial in S. Since S is a closed surface, this means each alphai
bounds a disk in S. Choose an innermost such disk D' cin S, that is, D' is
bounded by some alphai and doesn't contain any other alphaj in its interior.

Now construct a map phi colon S2 to M as follows. The closed upper hemisphere
is homeomorphic to D' cin S. Map it in along D'. Then the equator maps in along
f(alpha), which is contractible, as it's in D. Choose the lower hemisphere of
phi to correspond to such a contraction of f(alpha) within D. M is irreducible,
hence aspherical, so phi must be homotopically trivial. Homotoping phi to
a point and re-expanding, we can see that f|D' is homotopic to a map into D (ie
corresponding to a contracting homotopy of alpha). Pushing f slightly away from
D using a tubular neighborhood of D in M, we can eliminate the intersection
curve f(alpha) between f(S) and D. Since this homotopy only affects
a neighborhood of D' cin S, it cannot add any additional intersections or
affect any of the other intersection curves. Repeating this process, we can
eliminate all intersection curves by homotopy.

end proof

We have a similar fact for the pared locus of a pared 3-manifold.

prop

Let (M,P) be a pared 3-manifold where M is compact orientable irreducible, and
D cin M a compression disk for bd M. Then we can isotope P within bd M such
that P cap bd D = emptyset. Given any finite collection of disjoint compression
disks we can isotope P away from all of them.
