\section{Decomposition of pared 3-manifolds}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the geometrically finite case, we've reduced the quasi-Fuchsian surface
subgroup question to a topological problem about pi1-injective maps of
a surface into a pared 3-manifold. However, infinite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds may have quite complex topology, so it is not immediately clear how
to find such surfaces in the resulting pared 3-manifolds. It is not clear how
to find (QF) surfaces directly. Instead, we decompose the pared 3-manifold
along disks and annuli. While the precise statements and proofs that follow are
new, these are known facts and standard arguments.

% See Jaco, Jaco-Shalen, Johannson, Canary-McCullough

% Also see Canary-McCullough for JSJ for pared 3-manifolds!!

% NOTE NOTE these are the same arguments as I'm currently using in section
% 6 for specific book of I-bundles topology facts!! Need to straighten that
% out, avoid duplication, etc. Cite backwards to this section where needed.

First, a simple proposition.

prop

Let M be a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold. Let f colon S to M be
a pi1-injective map, where S is a closed surface.  Let D cin M be a compression
disk for bd M.  That is, D is properly embedded, and bd D does not bound a disk
in bd M.  Then f is homotopic to a map such that f(S) cap D = emptyset.  In
fact, if f is an embedding, we can isotope f(S) away from D.  Given any finite
collection of disjoint compression disks we can homotope (isotope) f away from
all of them.

end prop

proof

Intuitively, f is pi1-injective, so any loop where S crosses D is contractible
in D, hence contractible in S. Then use irreducibility and an innermost disk
argument.



end proof

We have a similar fact for the pared locus of a pared 3-manifold.

prop

Let (M,P) be a pared 3-manifold where M is compact orientable irreducible, and
D cin M a compression disk for bd M. Then we can isotope P within bd M such
that P cap bd D = emptyset. Given any finite collection of disjoint compression
disks we can isotope P away from all of them.

end prop
