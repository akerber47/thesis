\section{Decomposition of pared 3-manifolds}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the geometrically finite case, we've reduced the quasi-Fuchsian surface
subgroup question to a topological problem about pi1-injective maps of
a surface into a pared 3-manifold. However, infinite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds may have quite complex topology, so it is not immediately clear how
to find such surfaces in the resulting pared 3-manifolds. It is not clear how
to find (QF) surfaces directly. Instead, we decompose the pared 3-manifold
along disks and annuli. While the precise statements and proofs that follow are
new, these are known facts and standard arguments.

First, a simple proposition.

prop

Let M be a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold. Let f colon S to M be
a pi1-injective map, where S is a closed surface.  Let D cin M be a compression
disk for bd M.  That is, D is properly embedded, and bd D does not bound a disk
in bd M.  Then f is homotopic to a map such that f(S) cap D = emptyset. Given
any finite collection of disjoint compression disks we can homotope f away from
all of them.

end prop

proof

Intuitively, f is pi1-injective, so any loop where S crosses D is contractible
in D, hence contractible in S. Then use irreducibility and an innermost disk
argument.

More precisely, we proceed as follows. First suppose f is not necessarily an
embedding. Homotope f locally so it's transverse to D. D is compact and
properly embedded, and S is compact, so f-1(D) is a properly embedded compact
submanifold of S. That is, it's a union of finitely many disjoint simple closed
curves alpha1,dots,alphak. For each alphai, f(alphai) cin D, so f(alphai) is
homotopically trivial in M.  Since f is pi1-injective, each alphai must be
homotopically trivial in S. Since S is a closed surface, this means each alphai
bounds a disk in S. Choose an innermost such disk D' cin S, that is, D' is
bounded by some alphai and doesn't contain any other alphaj in its interior.

Now construct a map phi colon S2 to M as follows. The closed upper hemisphere
is homeomorphic to D' cin S. Map it in along D'. Then the equator maps in along
f(alpha), which is contractible, as it's in D. Choose the lower hemisphere of
phi to correspond to such a contraction of f(alpha) within D. M is irreducible,
hence aspherical, so phi must be homotopically trivial. Homotoping phi to
a point and re-expanding, we can see that f|D' is homotopic to a map into D (ie
corresponding to a contracting homotopy of alpha). Pushing f slightly away from
D using a tubular neighborhood of D in M, we can eliminate the intersection
curve f(alpha) between f(S) and D. Since this homotopy only affects
a neighborhood of D' cin S, it cannot add any additional intersections or
affect any of the other intersection curves. Repeating this process, we can
eliminate all intersection curves by homotopy.

end proof

We have a similar fact for the pared locus of a pared 3-manifold.

prop

Let (M,P) be a pared 3-manifold where M is compact orientable irreducible, and
D cin M a compression disk for bd M. Then we can isotope P within bd M such
that P has minimal intersection with bd D. In this minimal intersection, torus
components of P do not intersect D, and if we cut M along D, all the resulting
rectangles obtained by cutting annulus components of P are essential. We can
perform a similar operation for any finite collection of disjoint compression
disks.

end prop

proof

This is straightforward. Torus components of P cannot intersect bd D, as each
torus component of P is precisely a torus component of bd M. This is because
a torus cannot map pi1-injectively to any other genus surface, as it'd
correspond to a rank 2 abelian subgroup. So if bd D intersects a torus
component of P, it'd have to lie entirely inside it. Then D would be
a compression disk for this torus component, violating pi1-injectivity.

Now consider annulus components of P that lie on the boundary component F of
M that contains bd D. It is sufficient to consider the core curves of these
annuli, which are a disjoint set of simple closed curves in F. Our statement
now follows from the elementary fact (about curves on surfaces) that we can put
these in minimal position with respect to another simple closed curve, bd D,
such that the intersection contains only essential arcs. Briefly, if there are
inessential arcs, they cobound disks, so begin with the innermost disks and
isotope to remove any inessential arcs. Again, we can repeat this process for
any disjoint collection of compression disks. This completes the proof.

end proof

cor

Let (M,P) be a pared 3-manifold, and f colon S to M a pi1-injective map of
a closed surface. Suppose P0 is a component of P which has an essential
intersection with a compression disk D. Then fstar(pi1S) does not intersect any
conjugates of pi1P0, that is, P0 is not freely homotopic in M into any image of
a loop in S.

end cor

proof

Suppose not. 

% Is this even true? uh oh
