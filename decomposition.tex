\section{Decomposition of pared 3-manifolds}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the geometrically finite case, we've reduced the quasi-Fuchsian surface
subgroup question to a topological problem about $\pi_1$-injective maps of
a surface into a pared 3-manifold. However, infinite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds may have quite complex topology, so it is not immediately clear how
to find such surfaces in the resulting pared 3-manifolds. It is not clear how
to find (QF) surfaces directly. Instead, we decompose the pared 3-manifold
along disks and annuli. While the precise statements and proofs that follow are
new, these are standard techniques.

See \cite{Ja}, \cite{JacoShalen}, and \cite{Johannson} for an overview of the
JSJ theory we will use.  See \cite{CMc} for some discussion of JSJ theory for
pared 3-manifolds.  Note also that our choice of decomposition was inspired by
the decomposition used by Thurston to prove geometrization of Haken manifolds.
This is a decomposition into acylindrical pieces, $I$-bundles, and solid tori.
See \cite{Mo} or \cite{ThurstonIII} for details.

First, a few simple propositions.

\begin{prop}

Let $M$ be a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold. Let $f \colon S \to M$
be a $\pi_1$-injective map, where $S$ is a closed surface.  Let $D \cin M$ be
a compression disk for $\bd M$. That is, $D$ is properly embedded, and $\bd D$
does not bound a disk in $\bd M$. Then $f$ is homotopic to a map such that
$f(S) \cap D = \emptyset$. Given any finite collection of disjoint compression
disks we can homotope f away from all of them.

\end{prop}

\begin{proof}

Intuitively, $f$ is $\pi_1$-injective, so any loop where $S$ intersects $D$ is
contractible in $D$, hence contractible in $S$. Then use irreducibility and an
innermost disk argument.

More precisely, we proceed as follows. Homotope $f$ locally so it's transverse
to $D$. $D$ is compact and properly embedded, and $S$ is compact, so
$f^{-1}(D)$ is a properly embedded compact submanifold of $S$. That is, it's
a union of finitely many disjoint simple closed curves
$\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k$.  For each $\alpha_i$, $f(\alpha_i) \cin D$, so
$f(\alpha_i)$ is homotopically trivial in $M$.  Since $f$ is $\pi_1$-injective,
each $\alpha_i$ must be homotopically trivial in $S$.  Since $S$ is a closed
surface, this means each $\alpha_i$ bounds a disk in $S$.  Choose an innermost
such disk $D' \cin S$, that is, $D'$ is bounded by some $\alpha_i$ and doesn't
contain any other $\alpha_j$ in its interior.

Now construct a map $\phi \colon S^2 \to M$ as follows. The closed upper
hemisphere is homeomorphic to $D' \cin S$. Map it in along $D'$. Then the
equator maps in along $f(\alpha)$, which is contractible, as it's in $D$.
Choose the lower hemisphere of $\phi$ to correspond to such a contraction of
$f(\alpha)$ within $D$.  $M$ is irreducible, hence aspherical, so $\phi$ must
be homotopically trivial.  Homotoping $\phi$ to a point and re-expanding, we
can see that $f|_{D'}$ is homotopic to a map into $D$ (ie corresponding to
a contracting homotopy of $\alpha$). Pushing $f$ slightly away from $D$ using
a tubular neighborhood of $D$ in $M$, we can eliminate the intersection curve
$f(\alpha)$ between $f(S)$ and $D$.  Since this homotopy only affects
a neighborhood of $D' \cin S$, it cannot add any additional intersections or
affect any of the other intersection curves.  Repeating this process, we can
eliminate all intersection curves by homotopy.

\end{proof}

We have a similar fact for the pared locus of a pared 3-manifold.

\begin{prop}

Let $(M,P)$ be a pared 3-manifold where $M$ is compact orientable irreducible,
and $D \cin M$ a compression disk for $\bd M$. Then we can isotope $P$ within
$\bd M$ such that $P$ has minimal intersection with $\bd D$. In this minimal
intersection, torus components of $P$ do not intersect $D$, and if we cut $M$
along $D$, all the resulting rectangles obtained by cutting annulus components
of $P$ are essential.  We can perform a similar operation for any finite
collection of disjoint compression disks.

\end{prop}

proof

This is straightforward. Torus components of P cannot intersect bd D, as each
torus component of P is precisely a torus component of bd M. This is because
a torus cannot map $\pi_1$-injectively to any other genus surface, as it'd
correspond to a rank 2 abelian subgroup. So if bd D intersects a torus
component of P, it'd have to lie entirely inside it. Then D would be
a compression disk for this torus component, violating $\pi_1$-injectivity.

Now consider annulus components of P that lie on the boundary component F of
M that contains bd D. It is sufficient to consider the core curves of these
annuli, which are a disjoint set of simple closed curves in F. Our statement
now follows from the elementary fact (about curves on surfaces) that we can put
these in minimal position with respect to another simple closed curve, bd D,
such that the intersection contains only essential arcs. Briefly, if there are
inessential arcs, they cobound disks, so begin with the innermost disks and
isotope to remove any inessential arcs. Again, we can repeat this process for
any disjoint collection of compression disks. This completes the proof.

end proof

cor

Let (M,P) be a pared 3-manifold, and $f \colon S \to M$ a $\pi_1$-injective map
of a closed surface. Suppose P0 is a component of P which has an essential
intersection with a compression disk D. By abuse of notation, we'll refer to
its core curve as P0 as well. Then either:

(1) P0 is homotopic in M to a different curve in bd M that does not intersect
D. That is, there are sufficiently many compression disks cobounded by arcs in
P0 with endpoints on bd D that "transfer P0 across D to a different part of bd
M".

or

(2) fstar(pi1S) does not intersect any conjugates of pi1P0, that is, a multiple
of P0 is not freely homotopic in M into any image of a loop in S.

end cor

proof

Note that if the algebraic intersection number between P0 and D is nonzero, it
immediately follows that P0 cannot be homotoped in M into the image of a loop
in S (which would have to be disjoint from D). The algebraic intersection
number is a homotopy, indeed a homology invariant in M. So we need only
consider the case of zero algebraic intersection.

Deformation retract D to a point, and choose this as our basepoint for pi1M.
This yields an expression for pi1M as either a free product pi1M1 star pi1M2
(if M setminus D is disconnected) or trivial HNN extension pi1M0 star
= <pi1M0,t> (if M setminus D is connected). Since S can be homotped to be
disjoint from D, f star (pi1S) is contained in one of these subgroups
pi1M1,pi1M2,pi1M0.  Cutting P0 along D breaks it into a union of arcs, and
after the deformation retract this corresponds to a word in the free product
/ HNN with each arc inducing a single subgroup letter in the word (or pair of
letter, in the HNN case when the arc connects between the two copies of D in
M0).  In the HNN case, note that the zero algebraic intersection implies that
the number of times the stable generator t appears in such a word is the same
as the number of times t-1 appears.

But in the HNN case, t does not appear in fstar(pi1S).  Similarly, in the free
product case, words from only one of pi1M1 or pi1M2 appear in fstar(pi1S).
Without loss of generality say it's pi1M1. That is, in order for (2) to be
false, that is, for a multiple of P0 to appear in fstar(pi1S), we must have
sufficient cancellation in the element P0 to remove all powers of t, or all
letters from pi1M2. We claim that (1) holds in this case.

To see this, observe that pi1M is a \emph{trivial} free product or HNN, so
there are no added relations. The only way to produce an element in a subgroup
is if all the in-between letters are in fact trivial. For each letter in the
word that is trivial in its subgroup (pi1M1, pi1M2, or pi1M0), we have
a basepointed closed curve in M, which corresponds to a contractible boundary
arc in the original M (before deformation retract) with both endpoints on D.
Connect the endpoints of this arc with a segment along bd D to produce a closed
curve in bd M. This is homotopically trivial, by the above word argument.
Therefore, by Dehn's lemma, it bounds a disk in M. Pushing P0 along this disk
and slightly outside it moves it to a new position in bd M with fewer
intersections with bd D. Using an innermost disk argument, we can do this
isotopically to obtain (1).

end proof

Together these demonstrate that we can reduce our main problem when M admits
boundary compressions. All closed $\pi_1$-injective surfaces can be made to
avoid the compression disks, and all components of the pared structure can
either be made to avoid the compression disks (case (1)) or are irrelevant
because they cannot be homotoped into any closed $\pi_1$-injective surface
(case (2)). We push the case (1) pared structure components away from the
compression disks and discard the case (2) components. Note of course that no
case (1) component can fail to be $\pi_1$-injective, as it'd already fail to be
$\pi_1$-injective before the compression (by homotoping across the compression
disk). In fact the result is a new (possibly disconnected) pared 3-manifold.
The resulting (possibly disconnected) incompressible pared manifold contains
a (QF) surface if and only if the original does.

Therefore we can reduce to the case where M is a pared 3-manifold (compact
orientable irreducible) with incompressible boundary. However, in order to
understand the problem better, we want another type of decomposition, along
disjoint properly embedded essential annuli. We obtain the following similar
results for a decomposition along annuli.

prop

Let M is compact orientable irreducible with incompressible boundary, and $f
\colon S \to M$ be a $\pi_1$-injective map of a closed surface. Let A cin M be
a properly embedded annulus which is essential - that is, incompressible,
boundary incompressible, and not parallel to an annulus in bd M. Then f is
homotopic to a map such that f(S) cap A is a union of multiples of the core
curve of A. For a disjoint union of annuli, we have the same result.

end prop

proof

Homotope f to be transverse to A. As earlier, f-1(A) is a union of simple
closed curves in S.
%TODO

end proof

%TODO similar fact for pared structure + annuli -> must cross transversely

We will need the following definition.

defn

Let M be a compact 3-manifold with boundary which is not a 3-ball. M is
\emph{acylindrical} if every proper pi1-injective map A2 to M is homotopic into
bd M.

end defn

Note that strictly speaking, balls have incompressible boundary and satisfy the
acylindrical condition, but we will want to consider them as a separate case
later in this chapter. We have the following key fact from the theory of JSJ
decompositions.  Analogously to the Loop and Sphere Theorems, it allows us to
go from singular surfaces to embedded surfaces.

thm (The Annulus Theorem)

Let M be a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold with incompressible
boundary. If M is not acylindrical, then M admits a properly embedded essential
annulus.

end thm

proof

See \cite{JacoShalen} or \cite{Johannson}. See \cite{Scottannulus} for an
algebraic proof.

end proof

Construct a hierarchy for a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold M with
nonempty boundary as follows.  Let M0 = M.  Construct Mi+1 from Mi:

If i is even, choose a maximal set of disjoint non-parallel compression disks
Dik for the boundary of Mi. Cut Mi along these disks to obtain Mi+1.

If i is odd, choose a maximal set of disjoint non-parallel properly embedded
essential annuli Aik. Cut Mi along these annuli to obtain Mi+1.

In both cases, if Mi is not connected, we make these choices in all components.

defn

We refer to this as an \emph{alternating hierarchy} for M.

end defn

lemma ("alternating hierarchy lemma")

Let M be a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold with nonempty boundary.
Then the alternating hierarchy for M has finite length n. Each component of Mn
is either a ball or an acylindrical 3-manifold with incompressible boundary.

end lemma

proof

It is immediately clear that the hierarchy terminates in a union of balls and
acylindrical 3-manifolds with incompressible boundary. If any component did not
have incompressible boundary, we could cut along a compression disk.
Similarly, if any component was not acylindrical, we could apply the annulus
theorem to find an annulus to cut along. It remains to show that the hierarchy
is finite length.

By cutting out tubular neighborhoods of the disks and annuli we're removing, we
can embed each level of the hierarchy: Mn hookrightarrow Mn-1 hookrightarrow
dots hookrightarrow M0. Furthermore, by isotoping along a small tubular
neighborhood of the boundary, we can in fact embed each Mi into the interior of
Mi-1. The hierarchy induces a hierarchy of nested disjoint embedded surfaces bd
Mn, bd Mn-1, dots, bd M0. For odd i, each bd Mi is incompressible in Mi-1,
since we constructed Mi from a maximal set of compression disks for bd Mi-1.
We claim that each odd bd Mi is in fact incompressible in Mi-2.  Suppose not,
and let D cin Mi-2 be a compression disk for bd Mi. Let A cin Mi-2 be one of
the essential annuli that we cut along to obtain Mi-1. Both A and D are
properly embedded in Mi-2, so after making them transverse, A cap D is a union
of disjoint properly embedded arcs and curves in D.

First, suppose the intersection contains at least one closed curve. Take an
innermost such curve alpha cin A cap D --- that is, one such that its interior
disk D' does not intersect any other curves in A cap D.  alpha cannot be
essential in A, as otherwise D' would induce a compression of A, contradicting
the assumption that A was essential in Mi-2.  But A is an annulus, so this
implies alpha bounds a disk D'' in A. Since M is irreducible, the Mi are
irreducible as well.  So D' cup D'' bounds a ball in Mi-2, and we can isotope
D across this ball to remove the intersection.  Repeating this process, we can
remove all closed curve intersections.

We now claim that A and D cannot intersect in any arcs. If they do, choose an
outermost such arc --- that is an arc alpha cin A cap D such that, for some
beta cin bd D connecting the endpoints of alpha, alpha cup beta bounds a disk
D' that does not intersect any other arcs in A cap D. But bd D cin bd Mi-2, so
this D' is a boundary compression disk for A, contradicting the assumption that
A was essential. Therefore after this isotopy we can guarantee that D is
disjoint from A.

Repeating this for all such cutting annuli A, D passes to a properly embedded
disk in Mi-1. But bd Mi is incompressible in Mi-1, so bd D must bound a disk
D'' in bd Mi-1. The cutting annuli in Mi-2 induce boundary annuli in Mi-1. As
proven above, none of these annuli intersect D. No annuli can be contained in
D'' as they wouldn't be essential (as D'' is a boundary disk). So no annuli can
intersect D''. Therefore the disk D'' induces a boundary disk in Mi-2. This
proves that bd Mi is incompressible in Mi-2.

Furthermore, we claim that for odd i, unless the sequence has terminated (that
is, Mi=Mi-1=Mi-2), bd Mi is not boundary parallel in Mi-2. That is, bd Mi and
bd Mi-2 are not parallel in Mi-2. Suppose that they are. Observe that there
must be at least one properly embedded essential annulus A cin Mi-2 that we cut
along. Isotope Aa %TODO

This means that considering only the odd terms in this alternating
decomposition, we have a Haken hierarchy. Finite depth immediately follows from
Haken finiteness. This completes the proof.

end proof

We now combine the earlier propositions with this lemma. Given an alternating
hierarchy for a pared 3-manifold, at each stage, we can push the pared
structure to avoid any decomposition disks and have essential intersections
with the decomposition annuli. Note that our propositions above are not
sufficient to push the pared structures repeatedly down the hierarchy, as after
the first annular step in the decomposition the pared locus includes rectangles
(intersecting the annulus cuts essentially) in addition to annuli and tori.
Therefore, to make this argument precise, we'll need to generalize the above
propositions. But this ought to be straightforward.

At the bottom of the hierarchy is a union of acylindrical 3-manifolds and
balls. We make the following conjecture:

conj

Let (M,P) be a pared acylindrical 3-manifold. Then M admit a (QF) surface.

end conj

Intuitively, this is because any acylindrical 3-manifold M contain a great many
proper essential pi1-injective surfaces Si. If we combine Si with bd M where
they meet, this induces a map from a book of I-bundles M' into M. We believe
that applying a combination theorem, for instance that of Baker--Cooper
\cite{BCcombination} or Agol--Groves--Manning \cite{AGMcombination}, we can
guarantee (under the right conditions) that this map is pi1-injective. This
allows us to pull the problem back to M', pulling the pared structure back and
constructing a (QF) surface there. This will induce a (QF) surface in M.

We believe that in most cases with no acylindrical pieces (that is, manifolds
where the bottom of the hierarchy is a union of balls), there should still be
a (QF) surfaces. We hope the same book of I-bundles mapping argument should
work in most cases. More work is needed.

In the remainder of this paper, we address the case of books of I-bundles.
