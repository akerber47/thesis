\section{Topological decomposition of pared 3-manifolds}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Using the above propositions, we've reduced our question to a purely
topological one. However, the topology of infinite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds may be quite complex. It is not clear how to find (QF) surfaces
directly.

% TODO
\textbf{ TODO maybe here I can discuss how Baker-Cooper or Masters-Zhang did it
topologically for finite volume? Or even on how Cooper-Long-Reid solved the
topological problem without parabolics. Seems like as good a place as any...}

% TODO

\textbf{TODO finish this - Thurston decomp, acylindrical etc}
