Given a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold $N$, one can ask whether its fundamental
group $\Gamma=\pi_1N$ contains any quasi-Fuchsian surface subgroups.
Equivalently, given a pared 3-manifold $(M,P)$, one can ask whether there
exists a closed immersed $\pi_1$-injective surface in $M$ that avoids the
peripheral subgroups associated to $P$.  This is known to be true for closed
hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and more generally for finite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds. We outline a strategy to solve the case of infinite volume
hyperbolic 3-manifolds, that is, infinite covolume Kleinian groups.  We prove
results in the special case where $M$ is a book of $I$-bundles.
