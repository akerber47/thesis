Given a Kleinian group $\Gamma$, one can ask whether the group contains any
quasifuchsian surface subgroups. Equivalently, given a pared 3-manifold
$(M,P)$, one can ask whether there exists a closed immersed $\pi_1$-injective
surface in $M$ that avoids the peripheral subgroups associated to $P$.  This is
known to be true for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and more generally for
finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We derive explicit results for pared
3-manifolds $(M,P)$ where $M$ is a book of $I$-bundles.
