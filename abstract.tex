Given a Kleinian group $\Gamma$, one can ask whether the group contains any
quasi-Fuchsian surface subgroups. Equivalently, given a pared 3-manifold
$(M,P)$, one can ask whether there exists a closed immersed $\pi_1$-injective
surface in $M$ that avoids the peripheral subgroups associated to $P$.  This is
known to be true for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and more generally for
finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We outline a strategy to solve the case
of infinite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We prove explicit results in the
special case where $M$ is a book of $I$-bundles.
